title: "Univariate Statistics and Methodology in R"
---

Univariate Statistics and Methodology in R (USMR) is a semester long crash-course aimed at providing Masters students in psychology with a competence in standard statistical methodologies and data analysis using R. Typically the analyses taught in this course are relevant for when there is just one source of variation - i.e. when we are interested in a single outcome measured across a set of independent observations. The first half of the course covers the fundamentals of statistical inference using a simulation-based approach, and introduces students to working with R & RStudio. The latter half of the course focuses on the general linear model, emphasising the fact that many statistical methods are simply special cases of this approach. This course introduces students to statistical modelling and empowers them with tools to analyse richer data and answer a broader set of research questions.
