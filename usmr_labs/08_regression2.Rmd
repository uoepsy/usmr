# Interactions  

:::statbox
An *interaction* is a quantitative researcher's way of answering the question "what is the relationship between Y and X?" with, "well, it depends...".     
:::

## ~ Numeric * Categorical

Reseachers have become interested in how the number of social interactions might influence mental health and wellbeing differently for those living in rural communities compared to those in cities and suburbs. They want to assess whether the effect of social interactions on wellbeing _is moderated by_ (depends upon) whether or not a person lives in a rural area.  

Recall the data that we have been working with:  
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Read in data
mwdata = read_csv(file = "https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing.csv")
# count number of observations in each location
mwdata %>% count(location)
```

`r qbegin("B1")`  
**Open-ended:** Do you think there is enough data to answer this question?
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We have only 7 respondents who are from a rural location, and 25 from the city & suburbs. Intuitively, this doesn't seem very many to rely on as representative of the population of those living in rural areas in Edinburgh & Lothians. Another thing to think about is that we probably don't expect _large_ differences between rural and city dwellers in the effect of social interaction on wellbeing (i.e., we might not expect differences in the wellbeing~social interaction relationship between these sub-groups to be that strong relative to the overall relationship between social interaction and wellbeing).

> **Research Question:** 
> Does the relationship between number of social interactions and mental wellbeing differ between rural and non-rural residents?  

To investigate how the relationship between the number of social interactions and mental wellbeing might be different for those living in rural communities, the researchers conduct a new study, collecting data from 200 randomly selected residents of the Edinburgh & Lothian postcodes.

The data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing_rural.csv.  

__Description__

From the Edinburgh & Lothians, 100 city/suburb residences and 100 rural residences were chosen at random and contacted to participate in the study. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), was used to measure mental health and well-being. 
Participants filled out a questionnaire including items concerning: estimated average number of hours spent outdoors each week, estimated average number of social interactions each week (whether on-line or in-person), whether a daily routine is followed (yes/no). For those respondents who had an activity tracker app or smart watch, they were asked to provide their average weekly number of steps.  
  
The data in `wellbeing_rural.csv` contain seven attributes collected from a random sample of $n=200$ hypothetical residents over Edinburgh & Lothians, and include:  

- `wellbeing`: Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being. The scale is scored by summing responses to each item, with items answered on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The minimum scale score is 14 and the maximum is 70.  
- `outdoor_time`: Self report estimated number of hours per week spent outdoors  
- `social_int`: Self report estimated number of social interactions per week (both online and in-person)
- `routine`: Binary 1=Yes/0=No response to the question "Do you follow a daily routine throughout the week?"
- `location`: Location of primary residence (City, Suburb, Rural)
- `steps_k`: Average weekly number of steps in thousands (as given by activity tracker if available)
- `age`: Age in years of respondent

__Interactions in linear models__  

Specifying an interaction in a regression involves simply including the product of the two relevant predictor variables in your set of predictors. So if we are wanting to examine how the effect of $x$ on $y$ _depends on_ $z$, we would want to estimate a parameter $\beta$ such that our outcome is predicted by $\beta \cdot x \cdot z$. However, we also need to include $x$ and $z$ themselves: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x + \beta_2 \cdot z + \beta_3 \cdot x \cdot z$.  

:::frame
_"Except in special circumstances, a model including a product term for interaction between two explanatory variables should also include terms with each of the explanatory variables individually, even though their coefficients may not be significantly different from zero. Following this rule avoids the logical inconsistency of saying that the effect of $X_1$ depends on the level of $X_2$ but that there is no effect of $X_1$."_

`r qbegin("B2")`
Specify a multiple regression model to answer the research question.  
Read in the data, and assign it a name. Then fully explore the variables and relationships which are going to be used in your analysis.   

+ **Tip 1:** Install the `psych` package (remember to use the console, not your script to install packages), and then load it (load it in your script/Rmarkdown). The `pairs.panels()` function from this package will plot all variables in a dataset against one another. This will save you the time you would have spent creating individual plots.  
+ **Tip 2:** Check the "location" variable. It currently has three levels (Rural/Suburb/City), but we only want two (Rural/Not Rural). You'll need to fix this. One way to do this would be to use `ifelse()` to define a variable which takes one value ("Rural") if the observation meets from some condition, or another value ("Not Rural") if it does not. Type `?ifelse` in the **console** if you want to see the help function. You can use it to add a new variable either inside `mutate()`, or using `data$new_variable_name <- ifelse(test, x, y)` syntax. We used it briefly in the [previous set of exercises](07_regression.html#Binary_predictors).  

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
To address the research question, we are going to fit the following model:  
$$
\text{wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{outdoor_time} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{lives_rural} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{outdoor_time} \cdot \text{lives_rural} + \epsilon \\ 
\quad \\ \text{where} \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma) \text{ independently}
$$

First we read in the data, and take a quick look at our variables:
```{r}
mwdata2 <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing_rural.csv")
summary(mwdata2)
```

First let's create a new variable for Rural/Not Rural
```{r}
mwdata2 <- 
  mwdata2 %>% 
  mutate(
    isRural = ifelse(location == "rural", "rural","not rural")
  )
```

Now let's use `psych::pairs.panels()` function.  
We could use it on the whole dataset, but for now we'll just do it on the variables we're interested in:
```{r}
library(psych)
pairs.panels(mwdata2 %>% select(wellbeing, social_int, isRural))
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("B3")`

__Interpreting coefficients for A and B in the presence of an interaction A:B__   

When you include an interaction between $x_1$ and $x_2$ in a regression model, you are estimating the extent to which the effect of $x_1$ on $y$ is different across the values of $x_2$.  

What this means is that the effect of $x_1$ on $y$ *depends on/is conditional upon* the value of $x_2$.  
(and vice versa, the effect of $x_2$ on $y$ is different across the values of $x_1$).   
This means that we can no longer talk about the "effect of $x_1$ _holding $x_2$ constant_". Instead we can talk about a _conditional effect_ of $x_1$ on $y$ at a specific value of $x_2$. 

:::imp
When we fit the model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot x_1 + \beta_2 \cdot x_2 + \beta_3 \cdot x_1 \cdot x_2 + \epsilon$ using `lm()`:  

- the parameter estimate $\hat \beta_1$ is the _conditional effect_ of $x_1$ on $y$ where $x_2 = 0$  
- the parameter estimate $\hat \beta_2$ is the _conditional effect_ of $x_2$ on $y$ where $x_1 = 0$  
:::

<div style="margin-left: 15px">
<small>
__side note:__ Regardless of whether or not there is an interaction term in our model, all parameter estimates in multiple regression are "conditional" in the sense that they are dependent upon the inclusion of other variables in the model. For instance, in $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon$ the coefficient $\hat \beta_1$ is conditional upon holding $x_2$ constant. The difference with an interaction is that they are conditional upon $x_2$ being _at_ some specific value.  
</small>

:::statbox
__Interpreting the interaction term A:B__  

The coefficient for an interaction term can be thought of as providing an _adjustment to the slope._   
  
In our model: $\text{wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot\text{social-interactions} + \beta_2\cdot\text{isRural} + \beta_3\cdot\text{social-interactions}\cdot\text{isRural} + \epsilon$, we have a numeric*categorical interaction.  
The estimate $\hat \beta_3$ is the adjustment to the slope $\hat \beta_1$ to be made for the individuals in the $\text{isRural}=1$ group.

__Description__

Data from 656 participants containing information on scores on each trait of a Big 5 personality measure, their perception of their own social rank, and their scores on a measure of depression.  

The data in `scs_study.csv` contain seven attributes collected from a random sample of $n=656$ participants: 

- `zo`: Openness (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `zc`: Conscientiousness (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `ze`: Extraversion (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `za`: Agreeableness (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `zn`: Neuroticism (Z-scored), measured on the Big-5 Aspects Scale (BFAS)
- `scs`: Social Comparison Scale - An 11-item scale that measures an individual’s perception of their social rank, attractiveness and belonging relative to others. The scale is scored as a sum of the 11 items (each measured on a 5-point scale), with higher scores indicating more favourable perceptions of social rank.
- `dass`: Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale - The DASS-21 includes 21 items, each measured on a 4-point scale. The score is derived from the sum of all 21 items, with higher scores indicating higher a severity of symptoms.

__Refresher: Z-scores__

When we __standardise__ a variable, we re-express each value as the distance from the mean _in units of standard deviations._ These transformed values are called __z-scores.__  

To transform a given value $x_i$ into a __z-score__ $z_i$, we simply calculate the distance from $x_i$ to the mean, $\bar{x}$, and divide this by the standard deviation, $s$:    
$$
z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s}
$$

A Z-score of a value is the number of standard deviations below/above the mean that the value falls.

We named the data `scs_study` in our environment, but you will likely have named yours something different. Edit the code below accordingly to run it on your data.  
The code takes the dataset, and uses the `cut()` function to add a new variable called "zn_group", which is the "zn" variable split into 4 groups.  
<div style="margin-left:15px">
_Remember:_ we have re-assign this output as the name of the dataset (the `scs_study <- ` bit at the beginning) to make these changes occur in our __environment__ (the top-right window of Rstudio). If we didn't have the first line, then it would simply print the output.

The relationship between SCS scores and DASS-21 scores appears to be different between these groups. For those with a relatively high neuroticism score, the relationship seems stronger, while for those with a low neuroticism score there is almost no discernable relationship. 
This suggests an interaction - the relationship of DASS-21 ~ SCS differs across the values of neuroticism! 
`r solend()`

:::statbox

Cutting one of the explanatory variables up into groups essentially turns a numeric variable into a categorical one. We did this just to make it easier to visualise how a relationship changes across the values of another variable, because we can imagine a separate line for the relationship between SCS and DASS-21 scores for each of the groups of neuroticism. However, in grouping a numeric variable like this we lose information. Neuroticism is measured on a continuous scale, and we want to capture how the relationship between SCS and DASS-21 changes across that continuum (rather than cutting it into chunks).   
We could imagine cutting it into more and more chunks (see Figure \@ref(fig:reglinescut)), until what we end up with is a an infinite number of lines - i.e., a three-dimensional plane/surface (recall that in for a multiple regression model with 2 explanatory variables, we can think of the model as having three-dimensions). The inclusion of the interaction term simply results in this surface no longer being necessarily flat. You can see this in Figure \@ref(fig:3dint).

Recall that the coefficients `zn` and `scs` from our model now reflect the estimated change in the outcome associated with an increase of 1 in the explanatory variables, _when the other variable is zero._

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
The neuroticism variable `zn` is Z-scored, which means that 0 is the mean (it is mean-centered), and 1 is a standard deviation.   
  
The Social Comparison Scale variable `scs` is the raw-score. Looking back at the description of the variables, we can work out that the minimum possible score is 11 (if people respond 1 for each of the 11 questions) and the maximum is 55 (if they respond 5 for all questions). Is it meaningful/useful to talk about estimated effects for people who score 0? Not really.  

But we can make it so that zero represents something else, such as the minimum score, or the mean score. For instance, `scs_study$scs - 11` will subtract 11 from the scores, making zero the minimum possible score on the scale.  

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("B12")`
Recenter one or both of your explanatory variables to ensure that 0 is a meaningful value
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We're going to mean-center the scores on the SCS. Think about what someone who now scores zero on the `zn` variable *and* zero on the mean-centered SCS?  
```{r}
scs_study <-
  scs_study %>%
  mutate(
    scs_mc = scs - mean(scs)
  )
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("B13")`
We'll now re-fit the model using mean-centered SCS scores instead of the original variable. Here are the parameter estimates: 
```{r}
dass_mdl2 <- lm(dass ~ 1 + scs_mc * zn, data = scs_study)

# pull out the coefficients from the summary():

wbmod <- lm(wellbeing ~ 1 + social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata2)
summary(wbmod)$coefficients
```
units are in their raw form
social_int of 1 is 1 more social interaction per week
outdoor_time of 1 is 1 more hour per week
wellbeing is 1 point on the WMWBS

we can standardise some of them if we like!

```{r}
mwdata2 %>% mutate(
  z_socint = (social_int - mean(social_int)) / sd(social_int)
)
mwdata2 <- 
  mwdata2 %>% mutate(

# Exercises: Revisiting Assumptions 

TODO consider removing? 

`r qbegin("C1")`
Create a new section header in your Rmarkdown document, as we are moving onto a refresher on checking assumptions.  

1. You will have just fitted the following interaction model:
    - $\text{DASS-21 Score} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{SCS Score} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Neuroticism} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{SCS score} \cdot \text{Neuroticism} + \epsilon$ 
2. Check that your model meets the assumptions of the linear model (**Tip:** to get a broad overview you can pass your model to the `plot()` function to get a series of plots). 
3. If you notice any violated assumptions:  
    - address the issues by, e.g., excluding observations from the analysis, or replacing outliers with the next most extreme value (*Winsorisation*). 
    - after fitting a new model which you hope addresses violations, you need to check **all** of your assumptions again. It can be an iterative process, and the most important thing is that your _final_ model (the one you plan to **use**) meets all the assumptions.  

--- 

**Tips:** 

+ When there is an interaction in the model, assessing linearity becomes difficult. In fact, `crPlots()` will not work. To assess, you can create a residuals-vs-fitted plot like we saw in the previous week.  
+ Interaction terms often result in multicollinearity, because these terms are made up of the product of some 'main effects'. Mean-centering the variables like we have here will reduce this source of structural multicollinearity ("structural" here refers to the fact that multicollinearity is due to our model specification, rather than the data itself)  
+ You can fit a model and exclude specific observations. For instance, to remove the 3rd and 5th rows of the dataset: `lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = dataset[-c(3,5),])`. Be careful to remember that these values remain in the dataset, they have simply been excluded from the model fit.  

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

Recall our model: We're going to mean-center the `scs` variable from the outset. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
dass_mdl2 <- lm(dass ~ 1 + scs_mc * zn, data = scs_study)
plot(dass_mdl2)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
dass_mdl2 <- lm(dass ~ 1 + scs_mc * zn, data = scs_study)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(dass_mdl2)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

From quick visual inspection, it looks like there is at least one very influential point, which has been labelled for us as case number 35. 

```{r}
scs_study[35,]
```

The code below fits a new model and assigns it the name `dass_mdl3`. How is it different from the previous model?  

```{r}
dass_mdl3 <- lm(dass ~ 1 + scs_mc * zn, data = scs_study[-35, ])
```

Does this new model meet the assumptions of multiple regression?

### Incremental F-test  

:::imp
If (*and only if*) two models are __nested__ (one model contains all the predictors of the other and is fitted to the same data), we can compare them using an __incremental F-test.__  

This is a formal test of whether the additional predictors provide a better fitting model.  
Formally this is the test of:  

+ $H_0:$ coefficients for the added/ommitted variables are all zero.
+ $H_1:$ at least one of the added/ommitted variables has a coefficient that is not zero. 
:::

The F-ratio for comparing the residual sums of squares between two models can be calculated as:

$$
F_{(df_R-df_F),df_F} = \frac{(SSR_R-SSR_F)/(df_R-df_F)}{SSR_F / df_F} \\
\quad \\
\begin{align}
& \text{Where:} \\
& SSR_R = \text{residual sums of squares for the restricted model} \\
& SSR_F = \text{residual sums of squares for the full model} \\
& df_R = \text{residual degrees of freedom from the restricted model} \\
& df_F = \text{residual degrees of freedom from the full model} \\
\end{align}
$$
:::
:::rtip

**In R,** we can conduct an incremental F-test by constructing two models, and passing them to the `anova()` function: `anova(model1, model2)`. 

:::


`r qbegin("D2")`
The F-ratio you see at the bottom of `summary(model)` is actually a comparison between two models: your model (with some explanatory variables in predicting $y$) and __the null model.__ In regression, the null model can be thought of as the model in which all explanatory variables have zero regression coefficients. It is also referred to as the __intercept-only model__, because if all predictor variable coefficients are zero, then the only we are only estimating $y$ via an intercept (which will be the mean - $\bar y$).  

Use the code below to fit the null model.  
Then, use the `anova()` function to perform a model comparison between your earlier model (**wb_mdl1**) and the null model.  
Check that the F statistic is the same as that which is given at the bottom of `summary(wb_mdl1)`.  

```{r}
null_model <- lm(wellbeing ~ 1, data = mwdata2)
```

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
# fit the null model
null_model <- lm(wellbeing ~ 1, data = mwdata2)

# model comparison null vs wb_mdl1
anova(null_model, wb_mdl1)

# extract f statistic from summary of wb_mdl1
summary(wb_mdl1)$fstatistic
# we can retrieve the p-value:
fstat = summary(wb_mdl1)$fstatistic[1]
df_1 = summary(wb_mdl1)$fstatistic[2]
df_2 = summary(wb_mdl1)$fstatistic[3]
pf(fstat, df_1, df_2, lower.tail = FALSE)

Does weekly outdoor time explain a significant amount of variance in wellbeing scores over and above weekly social interactions and location (rural vs not-rural)?  

Provide an answer to this question by fitting and comparing two models (one of them you may already have fitted in an earlier question). 

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We can compare the following models which predict wellbeing scores from weekly social interactions and location, with and without weekly outdoor time.  

+ $\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Social Interactions} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{IsRural} + \epsilon$ 
+ $\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Social Interactions} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{IsRural} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Outdoor time} +  \epsilon$ 

We have already fitted the first model and assigned it the name `wb_mdl1`.  
We need to fit the second:
```{r}
wb_mdl2 <- lm(wellbeing ~ 1 + social_int + isRural + outdoor_time, data=mwdata2)
```

Let's look at the amount of variation in wellbeing scores explained by each model:
```{r}
summary(wb_mdl1)$adj.r.squared
summary(wb_mdl2)$adj.r.squared
```

The model *with* weekly outdoor time as a predictor explains 30\% of the variance, and the model *without* explains 25\%.  
Does including weekly outdoor time as a predictor provide a significantly better fit of the data (**wb_mdl2** compared to **wb_mdl1**)?  
```{r}
anova(wb_mdl1, wb_mdl2)
```
```{r include=FALSE}
mc <- anova(wb_mdl1, wb_mdl2)
names(mc)[6]<-"p"
```

:::int

### AIC & BIC  

We can also compare models using information criterion statistics, such as AIC and BIC. These combine information about the sample size, the number of model parameters and the residual sums of squares ($SS_{residual}$). Models do not need to be nested to be compared via AIC and BIC, but they need to have been fit to the same dataset.  
For both of these fit indices, lower values are better, and both include a penalty for the number of predictors in the model, although BIC's penalty is harsher:

$$
AIC = n\,\text{ln}\left( \frac{SS_{residual}}{n} \right) + 2k \\
\quad \\
BIC = n\,\text{ln}\left( \frac{SS_{residual}}{n} \right) + k\,\text{ln}(n) \\
\quad \\
\begin{align}
& \text{Where:} \\
& SS_{residual} = \text{sum of squares residuals} \\
& n = \text{sample size} \\
& k = \text{number of explanatory variables} \\
& \text{ln} = \text{natural log function} 
\end{align}
$$
:::

:::rtip

**In R,** we can calculate AIC and BIC by using the `AIC()` and `BIC()` functions.

`r qbegin("D4")`
The code below fits 5 different models:

```{r eval=FALSE}
model1 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata2)
model2 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time + age, data = mwdata2)
model3 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time + routine, data = mwdata2)
model4 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time + routine + age, data = mwdata2)
model5 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time + routine + steps_k, data = mwdata2)
```

For each of the below pairs of models, what methods are/are not available for us to use for comparison and why?  

+ `model1` vs `model2`
+ `model2` vs `model3`
+ `model1` vs `model4`
+ `model3` vs `model5`

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

+ `model1` vs `model2`  
  These models are nested - `model2` contains all the variables of `model1` and they are fitted on the same dataset.  
  We can therefore use an F-test, AIC or BIC.  
    
+ `model2` vs `model3`  
  These models are __not__ nested, but they are fitted on the same dataset.  
  We can therefore use AIC or BIC, but we cannot use an F-test.  
    
+ `model1` vs `model4`
  These models are nested - `model4` contains all the variables of `model1` and they are fitted on the same dataset.  
  We can therefore use an F-test, AIC or BIC.  
    
+ `model3` vs `model5`  
  These models are __not__ nested, and they are __not__ fitted on the same dataset. the "steps_k" variable contains missing values, and so these whole rows are excluded from `model5` (but they are included in `model3`). We cannot compare these models.

Returning to the data on Big 5 Personality traits, perceptions of social ranks, and depression and anxiety scale scores: 

> **Research question**   
> 
> + Beyond neuroticism and its interaction with social comparison, do other personality traits predict symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress?
>   

Construct and compare multiple regression models to answer this question. Remember to check that your models meet assumptions (for this exercises, a quick eyeball of the diagnostic plots will suffice. Were this an actual research project, you would want to provide a more thorough check, for instance conducting formal tests of the assumptions).  
<br>
Although the solutions are available immediately for this question, we strongly advocate that you attempt it yourself before looking at them. 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

We've already done this all earlier, but thus far, we should have read in the data, and mean-centered our social comparison scale scores:
```{r}
scs_study <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/scs_study.csv")
scs_study <- 
  scs_study %>%
  mutate(
    scs_mc = scs - mean(scs)
  )
```

The question is asking whether including a group of predictors (the O, C, E, A personality traits) improves model fit beyond a model with just neuoriticism, social comparison score and their interaction.  

Notice how our initial model has one very influential point, which we will remove:
```{r eval=FALSE}
dass_mod <- lm(dass ~ scs_mc * zn, data = scs_study)
plot(dass_mod)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
dass_mod <- lm(dass ~ scs_mc * zn, data = scs_study)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(dass_mod)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
dass_mod <- lm(dass ~ scs_mc * zn, data = scs_study[-35, ])
plot(dass_mod)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
dass_mod <- lm(dass ~ scs_mc * zn, data = scs_study[-35, ])
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(dass_mod)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

And our full model, with the other personality variables included:
```{r eval=FALSE}
dass_mod2 <- lm(dass ~ scs_mc * zn + zo + zc + ze + za, data = scs_study[-35, ])
plot(dass_mod2)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
dass_mod2 <- lm(dass ~ scs_mc * zn + zo + zc + ze + za, data = scs_study[-35, ])
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(dass_mod2)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

We can explore the individual coefficients of our full model, and we notice that none of the other personality variables (`zo`, `zc`, `ze`, `za`) significantly predict DASS-21 scores:
```{r}
summary(dass_mod2)
```

However, when we compare the two models, we find that including these predictors does significantly improve model fit. 
```{r}
anova(dass_mod, dass_mod2)
```

This may be a bit confusing - are we saying that none of openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, or extraversion significantly predict DASS-21 scores, but collectively they do?  
  
This sort of discrepancy can often be the result of multicollinearity. Note that there may be some correlation between the `za` and `ze` variables: 
```{r}
vif(dass_mod2)
```

What may actually be happening here is that one variable is _masking_ the effect of the other. Note that when we take one of them out, the other becomes significant: 
```{r}
lm(dass ~ scs_mc * zn + zo + zc + ze, data = scs_study[-35, ]) %>% summary
```
