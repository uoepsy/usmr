# Your first .Rmd file  


In order to be able to write and compile Rmarkdown documents (and do a whole load of other things which we are going to need throughout the course) we are now going to install a set of packages known collectively as the "tidyverse" (this includes the "rmarkdown" package).  

- **If you installed R/Rstudio on your own computer**, then in the __console__, type `install.packages("tidyverse")` and hit Enter. You may have to wait a while. 
- **If you are using rstudio.ppls.ed.ac.uk**, then we have already installed "tidyverse" and a few other useful packages for you, so you don't have to do anything!  


`r qbegin("Task - New .Rmd document",qlabel=FALSE)`
Open a new Rmarkdown document: __File > New File > R Markdown...__

When the box pops-up, give a title of your choice ("Intro lab", maybe?) and your name as the author.  
`r qend()`

## Writing code in a .Rmd file

The file which you have just created will have some template stuff in it. Delete everything below the first code chunk to start with a fresh document:

![](images/installing_intro/ss_newrmd.png)

`r qbegin("Task - Code-chunks",qlabel=FALSE)`
Insert a new code chunk by either using the Insert button in the top right of the document and selecting R, or by typing _Ctrl + Alt + i_ on Windows or _Option + Cmd + i_ on MacOS.

Inside the chunk, type:

`print("Hello world! My name is ?")`

To execute the code inside the chunk, you can either:  

+ do as you did in the R script - put the text-cursor on the first line, and hit Ctrl/Cmd + Enter to run the lines sequentially;
+ click the little green arrow at the top right of your code-chunk to run **all** of the code inside the chunk;
+ while your cursor is inside the code chunk, press Cmd + Shift + Enter to run **all** of the code inside the chunk.  

You can see that the output gets printed below.

`r qend()`


`r qbegin("Task - Load packages",qlabel=FALSE)`
We're going to use some functions which are in the __tidyverse__ package, which we already installed above (or which we installed for you on the server).  
To use the package, we need to load it.  

When writing analysis code, we want it to be __reproducible__ - we want to be able to give somebody else our code and the data, and ensure that they can get the same results. To do this, we need to show what packages we use.  
It is good practice to load any packages you use at the top of your code, so that users of your code will know what packages they will need to install to run your code.
  
In your first code chunk, type:
```{r}
# I'm going to use these packages in this document:
library(tidyverse)
```
and run the chunk.  

**NOTE:** You might get various messages popping up below when you run this chunk, that is fine.

:::yellow   
__Comments in code__  
Note that using `#` in R code makes that line a comment, which basically means that R will ignore the line. Comments are useful for you to remind yourself of what your code is doing.

`r qend()`

## Writing text in a .Rmd file

`r qbegin("Task - Writing headings",qlabel=FALSE)`
Place your cursor outside the code chunk, and __below__ the code chunk add a new line with the following:

 # R code examples  
`r qend()`

Note that when the # is used in a Rmarkdown file __outside__ of a code-chunk, it will make that line a heading when we finally get to _compiling_ the document. Below, what you see on the left will be compiled to look like those on the right:

:::green
**RECALL**:

- **Inside** a code-chunk, one or more #s will create a **comment**
- **Outside** a code-chunk, one ore more #s will create **headings**
:::

`r qbegin("Task - Writing content",qlabel=FALSE)`
In your Rmarkdown document, choose a few of the symbols below, and write an explanation of what it does, giving an example in a code chunk. You can see an example of the first few below. 

+ `+` 
+ `-`
+ `*`
+ `/`
+ `()`
+ `^`
+ `<-`
+ `<`
+ `>`
+ `<=`
+ `>=`
+ `==`
+ `!=`

`r qend()`




## Compiling a .Rmd file

`r qbegin("Task",qlabel=FALSE)`
By now, you should have an RMarkdown document (.Rmd) with your answers to the tasks we've been through today.  
  
Compile the document by clicking on the __Knit__ button at the top (it will ask you to save your document first). The little arrow to the right of the Knit button allows you to compile to either __.pdf__ or __.html__. 
`r qend()`
