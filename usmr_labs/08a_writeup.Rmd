**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

1. Construct a linear model from information in published paper. 
2. Evaluate a published analysis with respect to the thoroughness of information presented. 
3. Write-up and provide interpretation of a linear model analysis with multiple predictors

:::
  

# Write-up task  

Here, we're going to walk through a high-level step-by-step guide of what to include in a write-up of a statistical analysis. We're going to use an example analysis using one of the datasets we have worked with on a number of exercises in previous labs concerning personality traits, social comparison, and depression and anxiety.  

:::frame
The aim in writing should be that a reader is able to more or less replicate your analyses **without** referring to your R code. This requires detailing all of the steps you took in conducting the analysis.  
The point of using RMarkdown is that you can pull your results **directly** from the code. If your analysis changes, so does your report!  
  
You can find a .pdf of the take-everywhere write-up checklist [here](https://uoepsy.github.io/files/writeup_guide.pdf).

Data was obtained from https://uoepsy.github.io/data/scs_study.csv: a dataset containing information on `r nrow(scs_study)` participants, including Z-scores on the 5 personality traits assessed by the Big-Five Aspects Scale (BFAS) (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism). Participants were also assessed on the Social Comparison Scale (SCS), which is an 11-item scale measuring self-perception (relative to others) of social rank, attractiveness and belonging, and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) - a 21 item measure with higher scores indicating higher severity of symptoms. For both of these measures, only total scores are available. Items in the SCS are measured on a 5-point scale, giving minimum and maximum possible scores of 11 and 55 respectively. Items in the DASS-21 are measured on a 4-point scale, meaning that scores can range from a possible 21 to 84. 
  
All participant data was complete (no missing values), with scores on the SCS and the DASS-21 all within possible ranges (see Table \@ref(tab:scsdasstab)). Bivariate correlations show a moderate negative relationship between DASS-21 and SCS scores; a moderate positive relationship between DASS-21 and Neuroticism, and a weak positive correlation between SCS and Neuroticism. Additionally, a strong positive relationship is evident between Extraversion and Agreeableness (see Figure \@ref(fig:splom)).

To investigate whether, when controlling for other personality traits, neuroticism moderates the effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, total scores on the DASS-21 were modelled using multiple linear regression. The Z-scored measures on each of the big-five personality traits were included as predictors, along with scores on the SCS (Z-scored) and its interaction with the measure of Neuroticism.

To address the research question of whether neuroticism moderates the effect of social comparison on depression and anxiety, we will consider the hypothesis test that the interaction coefficient is equal to zero, where:  

$H_0: \beta_7 = 0$. The interaction between SCS and Neuroticism is equal to zero.

Results showed a significant conditional association between SCS scores (Z-scored) and DASS-21 Scores ($\beta$ = `r res[1,1]`,SE = `r res[1,2]`, p `r res[1,5]`), suggesting that for those at the mean level of neuroticism, scores on the DASS-21 decrease by `r res[1,1]` for every 1 standard deviation increase in SCS scores. A significant conditional association was also evident between Neuroticism (Z-scored) and DASS-21 Scores ($\beta$ = `r res[2,1]`,SE = `r res[2,2]`, p `r res[2,5]`), suggesting that for those who score the mean on the SCS, scores on the DASS-21 increase by `r res[2,1]` for every 1 standard deviation increase in neuroticism. 
Crucially, the association between social comparison and symptoms of depression and anxiety was found to be dependent upon the level of neuroticism, with a greater negative association between the two for those with high levels of neuroticism ($\beta$ = `r res[8,1]`,SE = `r res[8,2]`, p `r res[8,5]`). This interaction is visually presented in Figure \@ref(fig:intplot). 

The results presented here indicate that the association between social comparison and depression and anxiety may depend upon individuals' levels of neuroticism, with perceived social rank perhaps leading to more symptoms of depression and anxiety for highly neurotic individuals. However, it is important to note that we can make no claims on the directions of these associations from these data - it may be that social comparison leads to more depression and anxiety in neurotic individuals, but also consistent is the view that - for these individuals - higher levels of depression leads to a greater reduction in perceived social rank.

__Analysis__  

To investigate whether, when controlling for other personality traits, neuroticism moderates the effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, total scores on the DASS-21 were modelled using multiple linear regression. The Z-scored measures on each of the big-five personality traits were included as predictors, along with scores on the SCS (Z-scored) and its interaction with the measure of Neuroticism. Effects will be considered statistically significant at $\alpha = 0.01$. One observation was excluded from the final analysis as it was judged to be too influential on the model (Cook's Distance = `r round(cooks.distance(dass_mdl)[35],2)`).  
The final model was fitted to the remaining 655 observations, and took the form: 
$$
\text{DASS-21} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{O} + \beta_2 \text{C} + \beta_3 \text{E} + \beta_4 \text{A} + \beta_5 \text{N} + \beta_6 \text{SCS} + \beta_7 \text{SCS} \cdot \text{N} + \epsilon  \\
\begin{align}
\text{Where} \\
& \text{O = Openness} \\
& \text{C = Conscientiousness} \\
& \text{E = Extraversion} \\
& \text{A = Agreeableness} \\
& \text{N = Neuroticism} \\
\end{align}
$$

To address the research question of whether neuroticism moderates the effect of social comparison on depression and anxiety, we will consider the hypothesis test that the interaction coefficient is equal to zero, where:  

$H_0: \beta_7 = 0$. The interaction between SCS and Neuroticism is equal to zero.  
$H_1: \beta_7 \neq 0$. The interaction between SCS and Neuroticism is not equal to zero.  

The regression model met assumptions of linearity (see plot of model residuals vs fitted values, Figure \@ref(fig:linearityplot2)), homoscedasticity (non-constant variance test indicated no evidence against the null hypothesis that the error variance is constant across level of the response, $\chi^2(1)$=`r round(test_equalvar$ChiSquare, 2)`, $p$=`r round(test_equalvar$p, 3)`), independence of errors (Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation of residuals: $DW$=`r round(test_ind$dw,2)`, $p$=`r round(test_ind$p,3)`), and normality of error term (Shapiro-Wilk test indicated no evidence against the null hypothesis that the residuals were drawn from a normally distributed population: $W$=`r round(test_norm$statistic,2)`, $p$=`r round(test_norm$p,3)`).

__Results__  

Results showed a significant conditional association between SCS scores (Z-scored) and DASS-21 Scores ($\beta$ = `r res[1,1]`,SE = `r res[1,2]`, p `r res[1,5]`), suggesting that for those at the mean level of neuroticism, scores on the DASS-21 decrease by `r res[1,1]` for every 1 standard deviation increase in SCS scores. A significant conditional association was also evident between Neuroticism (Z-scored) and DASS-21 Scores ($\beta$ = `r res[2,1]`,SE = `r res[2,2]`, p `r res[2,5]`), suggesting that for those who score the mean on the SCS, scores on the DASS-21 increase by `r res[2,1]` for every 1 standard deviation increase in neuroticism. 
Crucially, the association between social comparison and symptoms of depression and anxiety was found to be dependent upon the level of neuroticism, with a greater negative association between the two for those with high levels of neuroticism ($\beta$ = `r res[8,1]`,SE = `r res[8,2]`, p `r res[8,5]`). This interaction is visually presented in Figure \@ref(fig:intplot2).   
The F-test for model utility was significant (F(`r fres[2]`,`r fres[3]`)=`r fres[1]`, p<.001), with the model explaining approximately `r round(summary(dass_mdl2)$adj.r.squared * 100, 1)`% of the variability in DASS-21 Scores. Full regression results including 95\% Confidence Intervals are shown in Table \@ref(tab:tabmodel2).   
The results presented here indicate that the association between social comparison and depression and anxiety may depend upon individuals' levels of neuroticism, with perceived social rank perhaps leading to more symptoms of depression and anxiety for highly neurotic individuals.
