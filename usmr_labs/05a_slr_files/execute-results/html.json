When both variables are continuous, it is nice and intuitive to envisage this as the 'line of best fit' on a scatterplot. For instance, in @fig-lmintro we see two variables `y` and `x`, and our linear regression model is the blue line.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![y regressed onto x.](05a_slr_files/figure-html/fig-lmintro-1.png){#fig-lmintro fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe're going to use the data in this plot for the remainder of the reading. If you wish to play around with it yourself, it is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/usmr_slr.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/usmr_slr.csv), and contains a sample of 100 observations on variables `x` and `y`.   \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmy_data <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/usmr_slr.csv\")\nhead(my_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n      x     y\n  <dbl> <dbl>\n1  3.19  4.42\n2  2.57  4.48\n3  3.91  2.72\n4  4.79  5.39\n5  4.00  3.85\n6  4.11  4.42\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-lmintro, above, highlights a linear relationship, where the data points are scattered around an underlying linear pattern with a roughly-constant spread as we move along `x`.  \n\nIn [4B: Covariance & Correlation](04b_covcor.html){target=\"_blank\"} we have already talked about one way to describe this relationship, by calculating either the covariance or the correlation between `x` and `y`. However, as we will see in the coming weeks, the linear model provides us with the scope to extend our analysis to many more situations - it is the building block of many more complex analytical methods.  \n\nThe simple linear regression model takes the form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& y = b_0 + b_1 \\ x + \\epsilon \\quad \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n:::column-margin\nYou will see a variety of different ways of specifying the linear model form in different resources, some use $\\beta$, some use $b$. Sometimes you will see $\\alpha$ instead of $b_0$.\n:::\n\nWe typically refer to the outcome ('dependent') variable with the letter $y$ and to our predictor ('explanatory'/'independent') variables with the letter $x$. When we construct a linear model we are trying to re-express our outcome variable $y$ with some linear transformation of our predictor variable $x$.  \n\nYou can think of this in broader terms as: \n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\color{red}{Outcome}\\color{} = \\color{blue}{Model}\\color{black}{} + Error\\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\n## The Model \n\nWhen we fit a simple regression model, the bit we refer to as the 'model' is the line that is defined by two numbers, an 'intercept' and a 'slope' (see @fig-slr):\n\n- the __intercept__, denoted $b_0$, is the point at which the line hits the y-axis (i.e. where $x=0$)\n- the __slope__, denoted $b_1$, is the angle of the line. It is the amount which the line increases for every 1 increase in $x$.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Simple linear regression model, with the systematic part of the model in blue](05a_slr_files/figure-html/fig-slr-1.png){#fig-slr fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis line implies some _predicted_ values for our observed $x$ values. For instance, we can see that when $x=3$, the model (the blue line) will predict that $y$ is approximately 4. If we take each of our datapoints, and project them up/down to the line, then we get our fitted values (@fig-slrfit). We often denote these as $\\hat y$ (or \"y hat\"), with the hat indicating that they are the model-estimated values of $y$. \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\color{red}{Outcome}\\color{black} \\qquad=\\qquad & \\color{blue}{Model}\\color{black}{} & +\\qquad Error\\\\\n\\color{red}{y}\\color{black} \\qquad = \\qquad & \\color{blue}{\\hat y}\\color{black} & +\\qquad \\epsilon \\quad \\\\\n\\color{red}{y}\\color{black} \\qquad = \\qquad & \\color{blue}{b_0 + b_1 \\ (x)}\\color{black} & +\\qquad \\epsilon \\quad \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Simple linear regression model, fitted values in blue](05a_slr_files/figure-html/fig-slrfit-1.png){#fig-slrfit fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The Error \n\nOur model is not perfect. It is a _model_ - i.e. it is a _simplification_ of the world, and so is inherently going to be inaccurate for individuals. This inaccuracy can be seen in our plots so far - some points are higher than the model predicts, some lower. These deviations from the model (shown by the red lines in @fig-slr2) from the model are the random error component $\\hat \\epsilon$, or \"residuals\".  \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nError &= \\color{red}{Outcome}\\color{black}-\\color{blue}{Model} \\\\\n\\hat{\\epsilon} &= \\color{red}{y}\\color{black}- \\color{blue}{\\hat{y}}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Simple linear regression model, with the systematic part of the model in blue, and residuals in red](05a_slr_files/figure-html/fig-slr2-1.png){#fig-slr2 fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn full, we should really write our linear regression model out as: \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& y = b_0 + b_1 \\ x + \\epsilon \\quad \\\\\n& \\text{where} \\\\\n& \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe new bit here: \"$\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}$\" means that the errors around the line have mean zero and constant spread as x varies (we'll read more about what this means later in this course, when we discuss the assumptions underlying regression). You can think of $\\sim N(0, \\sigma)$ as meaning \"normally distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of $\\sigma$\".  \n\nThe standard deviation of the errors, denoted by $\\sigma$ is an important quantity that our model estimates. It measures how much individual data points tend to deviate above and below the regression line. A small $\\sigma$ indicates that the points hug the line closely and we should expect fairly accurate predictions, while a large $\\sigma$ suggests that, even if we estimate the line perfectly, we can expect individual values to deviate from it by substantial amounts.\n\n$\\sigma$ is estimated by essentially averaging squared residuals (giving the variance) and taking the square-root:  \n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\hat \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{Residual}}{n - 2}} \\\\\n\\qquad \\\\\n& \\text{where} \\\\\n& SS_{Residual} = \\textrm{Sum of Squared Residuals} = \\sum_{i=1}^n{(\\epsilon_i)^2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Fitting Linear Models in R\n\n## lm()\n\nIn R it is very easy to fit linear models, we just need to use the `lm()` function.  \n\nThe syntax of the `lm()` function is:  \n\n```\nmodel_name <- lm(outcome ~ 1 + predictor, data = dataframe)\n```\n\nWe don't _have_ to include the `1 + ` when we specify the model, as this will be included by default, so we can also simply write: \n\n```\nmodel_name <- lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = dataframe)\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### What is the ~1 + doing?  \n\nThe fitted model can be written as\n$$\n\\hat y = \\hat b_0 + \\hat b_1 x\n$$\nThe predicted values for the outcome are equal to our intercept, $\\hat b_0$, plus our slope $\\hat b_1$ multiplied by the value on our explanatory variable $x$.  \nThe intercept is a _constant_. That is, we could write it as multiplied by 1:\n$$\n\\hat y = \\color{blue}{\\hat b_0}\\color{black}{}(\\color{green}{1}\\color{black}{})\\color{blue}{ + \\hat b_1 }\\color{black}{}(\\color{green}{x}\\color{black}{})\n$$\n\nWhen we specify the linear model in R, we include after the tilde sign `~` all the things which appear to the right of each of the $\\hat b$s (the bits in green in the equartion above). That's why the 1 is included. It is just saying \"we want the intercept, $b_0$, to be estimated\".   \n\n:::\n\n## Model Summary\n\nWe can then view lots of information by giving our model to the `summary()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_model <- lm(y ~ x, data = my_data)\nsummary(my_model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ x, data = my_data)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.4383 -0.6593  0.1075  0.5945  2.1867 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

What we're getting from our coefficient is the area of this new rectangle which has width = 1. Because width = 1, the area is also the height ($\\text{area} = \\text{width} \\times \\text{height} = 1 \\times \\text{height}$). So what we get is the amount that $y$ increases (the height) as $x$ increases by 1 (the width).  \n\nWe can see this working: \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncov(my_data$x, my_data$y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.6877738\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvar(my_data$x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.8823097\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThis calculation gives us the same linear regression slope of 0.78 that we see when we fit the model using `lm()`.  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncov(my_data$x, my_data$y)/var(my_data$x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.7795152\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## Model Predictions\n\nFurthermore, we can get out the model predicted values for $y$, the \"y hats\" ($\\hat y$), using functions such as:  \n\n- `predict(my_model)`\n- `fitted(my_model)`\n- `fitted.values(my_model)`\n- `my_model$fitted.values`\n\nA nice package which will come in handy is the __broom__ package.

Whereas we talked about coefficients being interpreted as \"the change in $y$ associated with a 1-unit increase in $x$\", for categorical explanatory variables, coefficients can be considered to examine differences in group means. However, they are actually doing exactly the same thing - the model is simply translating the levels (like \"Level1\"/\"Level2\", or \"Yes\"/\"No\", or \"High\"/\"Low\") in to 0s and 1s!  \nSo while we may have in our dataframe a categorical predictor like the middle column \"x_cat\", below, what is inputted into our model is more like the third column, \"isLevel2\". \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 100 × 3\n       y x_cat  isLevel2\n   <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>\n 1  5.90 level2        1\n 2  4.82 level2        1\n 3  5.70 level2        1\n 4  4.81 level2        1\n 5  2.42 level1        0\n 6  3.82 level1        0\n 7  3.88 level1        0\n 8  5.57 level2        1\n 9  6.25 level2        1\n10  3.51 level2        1\n# ℹ 90 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur coefficients are just the same as before. The intercept is where our predictor equals zero, and the slope is the change in our outcome variable associated with a 1-unit change in our predictor.  \n\nHowever, \"zero\" for this predictor variable now corresponds to a whole level. This is known as the \"reference level\". So the intercept is the estimated mean of $y$ when `x_cat == \"level1\"` (it will default to alphabetical, so \"level1\" will be treated as zero). Accordingly, the 1-unit change in our predictor (the move from \"zero\" to \"one\") corresponds to the estimated change in mean of $y$ when moving from \"level1\" to \"level2\" (i.e. the difference between the two levels). \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05a_slr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::  \n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Assumptions\n\nAll our work here is in aim of making **models of the world**.  \n\n- Models are models. They are simplifications. They are therefore wrong.  \n- Our residuals ( $y - \\hat{y}$ ) reflect everything that we **don't** account for in our model.  \n- In an ideal world, our model accounts for _all_ the systematic relationships. The leftovers (our residuals) are just random noise.  \n- If our model is mis-specified, or we don't measure some systematic relationship, then our residuals will reflect this.  \nWe check by examining how much \"like randomness\" the residuals appear to be (zero mean, normally distributed, constant variance, i.i.d (\"independent and identically distributed\"). These ideas tend to get referred to as our __\"assumptions\".__  \n- While we will **never** know whether our residuals contain only randomness (we can never observe everything), our ability to generalise from the model we fit on sample data to the wider population relies on these assumptions.  \n\n:::statbox\n__Assumptions in a nutshell__   \n\nIn using linear regression, we have assumptions about our model in that we assume that modelling the outcome variable as a **linear** combination of the explanatory variables is an appropriate thing to do.  \nWe also make certain assumptions about what we have _left out_ of our model - the **errors** component.    \n<!-- $$ -->\n<!-- \\color{red}{y} = \\color{blue}{\\underbrace{\\beta_0 \\cdot{} 1 + \\beta_1 \\cdot{} x_1 + ... + \\beta_k \\cdot x_k}_{X \\boldsymbol \\beta}} + \\varepsilon -->\n<!-- $$ -->\n\nSpecifically, we assume that our errors have __\"zero mean and constant variance\"__.  \n\n- mean of the residuals = zero across the predicted values on the linear predictor.  \n- spread of residuals is normally distributed and constant across the predicted values on the linear predictor.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### What does it look like?  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05a_slr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### What does it <b>not</b> look like?   \n\nThings look a bit wrong (like there is something systematic that we haven't accounted for), when our residuals do not have mean zero:  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05a_slr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr do not have constant variance: \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05a_slr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::rtip\n__Assumptions in R__  \n\nWe can get a lot of plots for this kind of thing by using __plot(model)__\n\nHere's what it looks like for a nice neat model:  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(my_model)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05a_slr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- Top Left: For the __Residuals vs Fitted__ plot, we want the red line to be horizontal at close to zero across the plot. We don't want the residuals (the points) to be fanning in/out.  \n- Top Right: For the __Normal Q-Q__ plot, we want the residuals (the points) to follow closely to the diagonal line, indicating that they are relatively normally distributed _(QQplots plot the values against the associated percentiles of the normal distribution. So if we had ten values, it would order them lowest to highest, then plot them on the y against the 10th, 20th, 30th.. and so on percentiles of the standard normal distribution (mean 0, SD 1))_.\n- Bottom Left: For the __Scale-Location__ plot, we want the red line to be horizontal across the plot. These plots allow us to examine the extent to which the variance of the residuals changes accross the fitted values. If it is angled, we are likely to see fanning in/out of the points in the residuals vs fitted plot.\n- Bottom Right: The __Residuals vs Leverage__ plot indicates points that might be of individual interest as they may be unduly influencing the model. There are funnel-shaped lines that will appear on this plot for messier data (not visible above as the data is too neat!), ideally, the further the residual is to the right, the closer to the 0 we want it to be.

On average, participants scored 23.5 (SD = 11.1) on the perceptual speed task. \n\nA simple linear regression model was fitted, with scores on the perceptual speed task regressed on to age. A significant association was found, with scores on the task decreasing by -0.7 with every year of age ($b = -0.695$, $SE = 0.28$, $t(128)=-2.47$, $p = 0.015$), suggesting that perception may get worse in older age.   \n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"tocify-extend-page\" data-unique=\"tocify-extend-page\" style=\"height: 0;\"></div>\n",
