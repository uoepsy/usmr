**A note on notation**  

You will see a variety of different ways of specifying the linear model form in different resources. 
Some use $\beta$, some use $b$.  
In the lectures, you have seen the form $\color{red}{y} = \color{blue}{b_0 \cdot{} 1 + b_1 \cdot{} x} + \epsilon$.  

In the exercises below, we will tend to use $\color{red}{Y} = \color{blue}{\beta_0 \cdot{} 1 + \beta_1 \cdot{} X} + \epsilon$, to denote our population model, which when fitted on some sample data becomes $\color{red}{\hat{Y}} = \color{blue}{\hat{\beta}_0 \cdot{} 1 + \hat{\beta_1} \cdot{} X} + \hat{\epsilon}$ (the little hats indicate that they are fitted estimates).

It's important to take regular breaks. This will help (a bit) with not getting overwhelmed. If you were to sit down and read through this all in one sitting, it would be completely understandable that you might end up shouting at your computer.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}

These things (both the statistics side and the programming side) take time - and repeated practice - to sink in.  


# Exercises: Simple regression  

`r qbegin("A1")` 
Let’s imagine a study into income disparity for workers in a local authority. We might carry out interviews and find that there is a link between the level of education and an employee’s income. Those with more formal education seem to be better paid. 
Now we wouldn’t have time to interview everyone who works for the local authority so we would have to interview a sample, say 10%.  

In this lab we will use the riverview data (available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/riverview.csv) to examine whether education level is related to income among the employees working for the city of Riverview, a hypothetical midwestern city in the US.  

`r optbegin('Data: riverview.csv', FALSE, show = TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
**Download link**

The data is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/riverview.csv.](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/riverview.csv){target="_blank"}

**Description**

The riverview data come from @Lewis-Beck2015 and contain five attributes collected from a random sample of $n=32$ employees working for the city of Riverview, a hypothetical midwestern city in the US. The attributes include:

- `education`: Years of formal education
- `income`: Annual income (in thousands of U.S. dollars)
- `seniority`: Years of seniority
- `gender`: Employee's gender
- `male`: Dummy coded gender variable (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
- `party`: Political party affiliation


**Preview**

The first six rows of the data are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

riverview <- read_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/riverview.csv')
kable(head(riverview), align='c') %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```
`r optend()`

Load the required libraries and import the riverview data into a variable named `riverview`.
`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

riverview <- read_csv(file = "https://uoepsy.github.io/data/riverview.csv")
head(riverview)
```
`r solend()`

## Exploring the data

`r qbegin("A2")`  
We first want to visualise and describe the *marginal distributions* (the distribution of each variable without reference to the values of the other variables) of employee incomes and education levels.

- You could use, for example, `geom_density()` for a density plot or `geom_histogram()` for a histogram.
- Look at the shape, centre and spread of the distribution. Is it symmetric or skewed? Is it unimodal or bimodal? 
- Do you notice any extreme observations?
  
`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
We can plot the marginal distribution of employee incomes as a density curve, and add a boxplot underneath to check for the presence of outliers.  

**Note:** The function `ggMarginal()` from the `ggExtra` library only works with scatterplots.

```{r fig.cap="Density plot and boxplot of employee incomes."}
ggplot(data = riverview, aes(x = income)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_boxplot(width = 1/300) +
  labs(x = "Income (in thousands of U.S. dollars)", 
       y = "Probability density")
```

```{r fig.cap='Density plot and boxplot of employee education levels.'}
ggplot(data = riverview, aes(x = education)) +
  geom_density() +
  geom_boxplot(width = 1/100) +
  labs(x = "Education (in years)", 
       y = "Probability density")
```


The plot suggests that the distribution of employee incomes is unimodal and most of the incomes are between roughly \$45,000 and \$70,000. 
The smallest income in the sample is about \$25,000 and the largest income is over \$80,000. (We could find the exact values using the `summary()` function).
This suggests there is a fair amount of variation in the data. 
Furthermore, the boxplot does not highlight any outliers in the data.

To further summarize the distribution, it is typical to compute and report numerical summary statistics such as the mean and standard deviation. One way to compute these values is to use the `summary()` function from the `tidyverse` library:

```{r}
riverview %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_incom = mean(income), 
    sd_income = sd(income),
    mean_edu = mean(education),
    sd_edu = sd(education)
    )
```

:::int
The marginal distribution of income is unimodal with a mean of approximately \$53,700. There is variation in employees' salaries (SD = \$14,553).  
The marginal distribution of education is unimodal with a mean of 16 years. There is variation in employees' level of education (SD = 4.4 years).  
:::

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A3")`  
After examining the marginal distributions of the variables of interest in the analysis, we typically move on to examining relationships between the variables.  
  
Visualise and describe the relationship between income and level of education among the employees in the sample.  

Think about:  

- *Direction* of association
- *Form* of association (can it be summarised well with a straight line?)  
- *Strength* of association (how closely do points fall to a recognizable pattern such as a line?)
- *Unusual observations* that do not fit the pattern of the rest of the observations and which are worth examining in more detail.  

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
We are trying to investigate how income varies when varying years of formal education.
Hence income is the dependent variable (on the y-axis), and education is the independent variable (on the x-axis).

```{r riverview-scatterplot, fig.cap='The relationship between employees\' education level and income.'}
ggplot(data = riverview, aes(x = education, y = income)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Education (in years)", 
       y = "Income (in thousands of U.S. dollars)")
```

To comment on the strength of the linear association we compute the correlation coefficient:
```{r}
riverview %>%
  select(education, income) %>%
  cor()
```

that is, 
$$
r_{\text{education, income}} = 0.79
$$

We might write:

:::int
There is a strong positive linear relationship between education level and income for the employees in the sample.
High incomes tend to be observed, on average, with more years of formal education.
The scatterplot does not highlight any outliers.
:::
`r solend()`

## Fitting a model

`r qbegin("A4")`
The scatterplot highlights a linear relationship, where the data points are scattered around an underlying linear pattern with a roughly-constant spread as x varies.

Hence, we will try to fit a simple (one $x$ variable only) linear regression model:

$$
Income = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ Education + \epsilon \quad \\
\text{where} \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma) \text{ independently}
$$

where "$\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma) \text{ independently}$" means that the errors around the line have mean zero and constant spread as x varies.  


**Fit the linear model to the sample data using the `lm()` function and name the output `mdl`.**


_**Hint:**_
_The syntax of the `lm()` function is: _
```
lm(<response variable> ~ 1 + <explanatory variable>, data = <dataframe>)
```

`r optbegin("Why ~ 1?", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
The fitted model can be written as
$$
\widehat{Income} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 \ Education
$$
or
$$
\widehat{Income} = \hat \beta_0 \cdot 1 + \hat \beta_1 \cdot Education
$$

When we specify the linear model in R, we include after the tilde sign, `~`, the variables that appear to the right of the $\hat \beta$s. That's why the 1 is included.  
`r optend()`
`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
As the variables are in the `riverview` dataframe, we would write:  
```{r}
mdl <- lm(income ~ 1 + education, data = riverview)
```

`r solend()`

## Interpreting coefficients

`r qbegin("A5")`
Interpret the estimated intercept and slope in the context of the question of interest.  

To obtain the estimated regression coefficients you can either:  

- type `mdl`, i.e. simply invoke the name of the fitted model;
- type `mdl$coefficients`;
- use the `coef(mdl)` function;
- use the `coefficients(mdl)` function;
- use the `summary(mdl)` function and look under the "Estimate" column.

The estimated parameters returned by the above methods are all equivalent. However, `summary()` returns more information and you need to look under the column "Estimate".  
`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
coef(mdl)
```
The fitted line is:
$$
\widehat{Income} = 11.32 + 2.65 \ Education \\
$$


We can interpret the estimated intercept as follows,

:::int
The estimated average income associated to zero years of formal education is \$11,321.
:::

For the estimated slope we might write,

:::int
The estimated increase in average income associated to a one year increase in education is \$2,651.
:::
`r solend()`

:::frame
The parameter estimates from our simple linear regression model take the form of a line, representing the systemtic part of our model $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x$, which in our case is $11.32 + 2.65 \ Education$. Deviations from the line are determined by the random error component $\hat \epsilon$ (the red lines in Figure \@ref(fig:figslr) below).  

```{r figslr, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Simple linear regression model, with systematic part of the model in blue and residuals in red"}
betas <- coef(mdl)
intercept <- betas[1]
slope <- betas[2]

broom::augment(mdl) %>%
ggplot(., aes(x = education, y = income)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope, 
              color = 'blue', size = 1) + 
  labs(x = "Education (in years)", 
       y = "Income (in thousands of U.S. dollars)")+
  geom_segment(aes(x=education, xend=education, y=income, yend=.fitted), col="red",lty="dotted")
```

:::

## Interpreting $\sigma$

`r qbegin("A6")`
Consider the following:  

1. In fitting a linear regression model, we make the assumption that the errors around the line are normally distributed around zero (this is the $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma)$ bit.)  
2. About 95\% of values from a normal distribution fall within two standard deviations of the centre.  

We can obtain the estimated standard deviation of the errors ($\hat \sigma$) from the fitted model using `sigma(mdl)`.  
What does this tell us?  

`r optbegin('Huh? What is $\\sigma$?', olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
The standard deviation of the errors, denoted by $\sigma$ is an important quantity to estimate because it measures how much individual data points tend to deviate above and below the regression line. 

A small $\sigma$ indicates that the points hug the line closely and we should expect fairly accurate predictions, while a large $\sigma$ suggests that, even if we estimate the line perfectly, we can expect individual values to deviate from it by substantial amounts.

The *estimated* standard deviation of the errors is (surprisingly) denoted $\hat \sigma$ and is equal to
$$
\hat \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{SS_{Residual}}{n - 2}} \\
\begin{align}
& \text{where} \\
& SS_{Residual} = \sum_{i=1}^n{(\epsilon_i)^2}
\end{align}
$$
`r optend()`

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
The estimated standard deviation of the errors can be equivalently obtained by:

- typing `sigma(mdl)`;
- looking at the "Residual standard error" entry of the `summary(mdl)` output.

_**Note:** The term "Residual standard error" is a misnomer, as the help page for `sigma` says (check `?sigma`). However, it's hard to get rid of this bad name as it has been used in too many books showing R output._


```{r}
sigma(mdl)
```

:::int
For any particular level of education, employee incomes should be distributed above and below the regression line with standard deviation estimated to be $\hat \sigma = 8.98$. 
Since $2 \hat \sigma = 2 (8.98) = 17.96$, we expect most (about 95\%) of the employee incomes to be within about \$18,000 from the regression line.
:::  

`r solend()`

## Inference for regression coefficients  

:::frame
To quantify the amount of uncertainty in each estimated coefficient that is due to sampling variability, we use the standard error (SE) of the coefficient. 
_Recall that a standard error gives a numerical answer to the question of how variable a statistic will be because of random sampling._  

The standard errors are found in the column "Std. Error" of the `summary()` of a model:
```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(mdl)$coefficients
```

In this example the slope, 2.651, has a standard error of 0.37. One way to envision this is as a distribution. Our best guess (mean) for the slope parameter is 2.651. The standard deviation of this distribution is 0.37, which indicates the precision (uncertainty) of our estimate.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Sampling distribution of the slope coefficient. The distribution is approximately bell-shaped with a mean of 2.651 and a standard error of 0.37.'}
ggplot(tibble(x = c(-3 * 0.37 + 2.651, 3 * 0.37 + 2.651)), aes(x = x)) +
    stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 2.651, sd = 0.37)) +
  labs(x = "Estimate for employee incomes", y = '')
```

We can perform a test against the null hypothesis that the estimate is zero. Our test statistic: 
The reference distribution in this case is a t-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom, where $n$ is the sample size, and our test statistic is:  
$$
t = \frac{\hat \beta_1 - 0}{SE(\hat \beta_1)}
$$

:::


`r qbegin("A7")`
Test the hypothesis that the population slope is zero --- that is, that there is no linear association between income and education level in the population.  
(Hint: you can find all the necessary information in `summary(mdl)`)
`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
The information is already contained in the row corresponding to the variable "education" in the output of `summary(mdl)`, which reports the t-statistic under `t value` and the p-value under `Pr(>|t|)`:
```{r}
summary(mdl)
```

Before we interpret the results, recall that the p-value `5.56e-08` in the `Pr(>|t|)` column simply means $5.56 \times 10^{-8}$. This is a very small value, hence we will report it as <.001 following the APA guidelines.

:::int
We performed a t-test against the null hypothesis that education is not a significant predictor of income: $t(30) = 7.173,\ p < .001$, two-sided.
The large t-statistic leads to a very small p-value, meaning that we have strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
:::

`r solend()`

## Fitted and predicted values  

:::frame
To compute the model-predicted values for the data in the sample:

- `predict(<fitted model>)`
- `fitted(<fitted model>)`
- `fitted.values(<fitted model>)`
- `mdl$fitted.values`

```{r}
predict(mdl)
```


To compute model-predicted values for other data:

- `predict(<fitted model>, newdata = <dataframe>)`

```{r}
# make a tibble/dataframe with values for the predictor:
education_query <- tibble(education = c(11, 18))
# model predicted values of income, for the values of education
# inside the "education_query" data
predict(mdl, newdata = education_query)
```
:::

`r qbegin("A8")`
Compute the model-predicted income for someone with 1 year of education.  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
education_query <- tibble(education = c(1))
predict(mdl, newdata = education_query)
```
`r solend()`

## Partitioning variation  

:::frame
We might ask ourselves if the model is useful. To quantify and assess model utility, we split the total variability of the response into two terms: the variability explained by the model plus the variability left unexplained in the residuals.

$$
\text{total variability in response = variability explained by model + unexplained variability in residuals}
$$

Each term is quantified by a sum of squares:

$$
\begin{aligned}
SS_{Total} &= SS_{Model} + SS_{Residual} \\
\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar y)^2 &= \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat y_i - \bar y)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat y_i)^2 \\
\quad \\
\text{Where:} \\
y_i = \text{observed value} \\
\bar{y} = \text{mean} \\
\hat{y}_i = \text{model predicted value} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The R-squared coefficient is defined as the proportion of the total variability in the outcome variable which is explained by our model:  
$$
R^2 = \frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}
$$
:::


`r qbegin("A9")`
What is the proportion of the total variability in incomes explained by the linear relationship with education level?

_**Hint:** The question asks to compute the value of $R^2$, but you might be able to find it already computed somewhere._
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
summary(mdl)
```

The output of `summary()` displays the R-squared value in the following line:
```
Multiple R-squared:  0.6317
```

For the moment, ignore "Adjusted R-squared". We will come back to this later on. 

`r optbegin("Optional - Manual calculation of R-Squared", olabel=F, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
riverview_fitted <- riverview %>%
  mutate(
    income_hat = predict(mdl),
    resid = income - income_hat
  )
head(riverview_fitted)

riverview_fitted %>%
  summarise(
    SSModel = sum( (income_hat - mean(income))^2 ),
    SSTotal = sum( (income - mean(income))^2 )
  ) %>%
  summarise(
    RSquared = SSModel / SSTotal
  )
```

`r optend()`

:::int
Approximately 63\% of the total variability in employee incomes is explained by the linear association with education level.
:::

`r solend()`

## Testing Model Utility

:::frame
To test if the model is useful --- that is, if the explanatory variable is a useful predictor of the response --- we test the following hypotheses:

$$
\begin{aligned}
H_0 &: \text{the model is ineffective, } \beta_1 = 0 \\
H_1 &: \text{the model is effective, } \beta_1 \neq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
The relevant test-statistic is the F-statistic:

$$
\begin{split}
F = \frac{MS_{Model}}{MS_{Residual}} = \frac{SS_{Model} / 1}{SS_{Residual} / (n-2)}
\end{split}
$$

which compares the amount of variation in the response explained by the model to the amount of variation left unexplained in the residuals.

The sample F-statistic is compared to an F-distribution with $df_{1} = 1$ and $df_{2} = n - 2$ degrees of freedom.^[
$SS_{Total}$ has $n - 1$ degrees of freedom as one degree of freedom is lost in estimating the population mean with the sample mean $\bar{y}$.
$SS_{Residual}$ has $n - 2$ degrees of freedom. There are $n$ residuals, but two degrees of freedom are lost in estimating the intercept and slope of the line used to obtain the $\hat y_i$s.
Hence, by difference, $SS_{Model}$ has $n - 1 - (n - 2) = 1$ degree of freedom.
]

`r optbegin('Optional: Another formula for the F-test. Click the plus to expand &#8594;', olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
With some algebra we can also show that:
$$
F = \frac{R^2 / 1}{(1 - R^2) / (n - 2) } = \frac{R^2 / df_{Model}}{(1 - R^2) / df_{Residual} }
$$

Proof:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F = \frac{SS_{Model} / 1}{SS_{Residual} / (n - 2)} 
= \frac{\frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}}}{\frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}} \cdot \frac{1}{(n - 2)}} 
= \frac{R^2 / 1}{(1 - R^2) / (n - 2)}
\end{aligned}
$$
`r optend()`

:::

`r qbegin("A10")`
Look at the output of `summary(mdl)`. Identify the relevant information to conduct an F-test against the null hypothesis that the model is ineffective at predicting income using education level.
`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
summary(mdl)
```

The relevant row is the following:
```
F-statistic: 51.45 on 1 and 30 DF,  p-value: 5.562e-08
```
We might write up the test results as,

:::int
We performed an F-test for the overall significance of the regression, $F(1, 30) = 51.45, p < .001$.
The large F-statistic leads to a very small p-value ($<.001$), meaning that we have very strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the model is ineffective.

In other words, the data provide strong evidence that education is an effective predictor of income.
:::

`r solend()`

`r optbegin('Optional: Equivalence of t-test for the slope and model utility F-test in SLR. Click the plus to expand &#8594;', olabel = FALSE,  toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
**In simple linear regression only**, the F-statistic for overall model significance is equal to the square of the t-statistic for $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$.

You can check that the squared t-statistic is equal, up to rounding error, to the F-statistic:
```{r}
summary(mdl)$fstatistic['value']
summary(mdl)$coefficients['education','t value']
```
$$
t^2 = F \\
7.173^2 = 51.452
$$


Here we will show the equivalence of the F-test for model effectiveness and t-test for the slope.

Recall the formula of the sum of squares due to the model. We will rewrite it in an equivalent form below:
$$
\begin{aligned}
SS_{Model} &= \sum_i (\hat y_i - \bar y)^2 \\
&= \sum_i (\hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 x_i - \bar y)^2 \\
&= \sum_i (\bar y - \hat \beta_1 \bar x + \hat \beta_1 x_i - \bar y)^2 \\
&= \sum_i (\hat \beta_1 (x_i - \bar x))^2 \\
&= \hat \beta_1^2 \sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

The F-statistic is given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
F = \frac{SS_{Model} / 1}{SS_{Residual} / (n - 2)} 
= \frac{\hat \beta_1^2 \sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2}{\hat \sigma^2} 
= \frac{\hat \beta_1^2 }{\hat \sigma^2 / \sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now recall the formula of the t-statistic,
$$
t = \frac{\hat \beta_1}{SE(\hat \beta_1)} = \frac{\hat \beta_1}{\hat \sigma / \sqrt{\sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2}}
$$

It is evident that the latter is obtained as the square root of the former.

# Exercises: Multiple Regression 

In this next block of exercises, we move from the simple linear regression model (one outcome variable, one explanatory variable) to the _multiple regression model_ (one outcome variable, multiple explanatory variables).  
Everything we just learned about simple linear regression can be extended (with minor modification) to the multiple regression model. The key conceptual difference is that for simple linear regression we think of the distribution of errors at some fixed value of the explanatory variable, and for multiple linear regression, we think about the distribution of errors at fixed set of values for all our explanatory variables.

The researchers know that other aspects of peoples' lifestyles such as how much social interaction they have can influence their mental well-being. They would like to study whether there is a relationship between well-being and time spent outdoors *after* taking into account the relationship between well-being and social interactions.  

<!-- We previously used simple linear regression to examine whether score on the WMBWS was related to the amount of time spent outdoors (self-reported as the average number of hours per week).

The data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing.csv.   
  
__Description__

Researchers interviewed 32 participants, selected at random from the population of residents of Edinburgh & Lothians. They used the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being. The scale is scored by summing responses to each item, with items answered on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The minimum scale score is 14 and the maximum is 70.  
The researchers also asked participants to estimate the average number of hours they spend outdoors each week, the average number of social interactions they have each week (whether on-line or in-person), and whether they believe that they stick to a routine throughout the week (Yes/No).  

The data in `wellbeing.csv` contain five attributes collected from a random sample of $n=32$ hypothetical residents over Edinburgh & Lothians, and include:

- `wellbeing`: Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being. The scale is scored by summing responses to each item, with items answered on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The minimum scale score is 14 and the maximum is 70.  
- `outdoor_time`: Self report estimated number of hours per week spent outdoors  
- `social_int`: Self report estimated number of social interactions per week (both online and in-person)
- `routine`: Binary Yes/No response to the question "Do you follow a daily routine throughout the week?"

A table showing the correlation coefficients - $r_{(x,y)}=\frac{\mathrm{cov}(x,y)}{s_xs_y}$ - between variables. Each cell in the table shows the relationship between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).  

**Hint:** We can create a correlation matrix easily by giving the `cor()` function a dataframe. However, we only want to give it 3 columns here. Think about how we select specific columns, either using `select()`, or giving the column numbers inside `[]`.

**Model formula**

For multiple linear regression, the model formula is an extension of the one predictor ("simple") regression model, to include any number of predictors:  
$$
y = \beta_0 \ + \ \beta_1 x_1 \ + \ \beta_2 x_2 \ + \ ... \ + \beta_k x_k \ + \ \epsilon \\ 
\quad \\ 
\text{where} \quad \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma) \text{ independently}
$$

In the model specified above,

- $\mu_{y|x_1, x_2, ..., x_k} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x_2 + ... \beta_k x_k$ represents the systematic part of the model giving the mean of $y$ at each combination of values of variables $x_1$-$x_k$;
- $\epsilon$ represents the error (deviation) from that mean, and the errors are independent from one another.    
  
__Visual__

Note that for simple linear regression we talked about our model as a _line_ in 2 dimensions: the systematic part $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x$ defined a line for $\mu_y$ across the possible values of $x$, with $\epsilon$ as the random deviations from that line. But in multiple regression we have more than two variables making up our model. 

In this particular case of three variables (one outcome + two explanatory), we can think of our model as a _regression surface_ (See Figure \@ref(fig:regsurf)). The systematic part of our model defines the surface across a range of possible values of both $x_1$ *and* $x_2$. Deviations from the surface are determined by the random error component, $\hat \epsilon$.  

```{r regsurf, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Regression surface for wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, from two different angles", out.width="100%"}
fit<-lm(wellbeing~outdoor_time+social_int, data=mwdata)
steps=50
outdoor_time <- with(mwdata, seq(min(outdoor_time),max(outdoor_time),length=steps))
social_int <- with(mwdata, seq(min(social_int),max(social_int),length=steps))
newdat <- expand.grid(outdoor_time=outdoor_time, social_int=social_int)
wellbeing <- matrix(predict(fit, newdat), steps, steps)


par(mfrow=c(1,2))
p <- persp(outdoor_time,social_int,wellbeing, theta = 35,phi=10, col = NA)
obs <- with(mwdata, trans3d(outdoor_time,social_int, wellbeing, p))
pred <- with(mwdata, trans3d(outdoor_time, social_int, fitted(fit), p))
points(obs, col = "red", pch = 16)
#points(pred, col = "blue", pch = 16)
segments(obs$x, obs$y, pred$x, pred$y)

p <- persp(outdoor_time,social_int,wellbeing, theta = -35,phi=10, col = NA)
obs <- with(mwdata, trans3d(outdoor_time,social_int, wellbeing, p))
pred <- with(mwdata, trans3d(outdoor_time, social_int, fitted(fit), p))
points(obs, col = "red", pch = 16)
#points(pred, col = "blue", pch = 16)
segments(obs$x, obs$y, pred$x, pred$y)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

Don't worry about trying to figure out how to visualise it if we had any more explanatory variables! We can only concieve of 3 spatial dimensions. One could imagine this surface changing over time, which would bring in a 4th dimension, but beyond that, it's not worth trying!.

:::

`r qbegin("B5")`  
The scatterplots we created in an earlier exercise show moderate, positive, and linear relationships both between outdoor time and wellbeing, and between numbers of social interactions and wellbeing.  

In R, using `lm()`, fit the linear model specified by the formula below, assigning the output to an object called `wb_mdl1`.  

$$
Wellbeing = \beta_0 \ + \ \beta_1 \cdot Outdoor Time \ + \ \beta_2 \cdot Social Interactions \ + \ \epsilon
$$

*Tip:*
As we did for simple linear regression, we can fit our multiple regression model using the `lm()` function. We can add as many explanatory variables as we like, separating them with a `+`.  
```
lm( <response variable> ~ 1 + <explanatory variable 1> + <explanatory variable 2> + ... , data = <dataframe>)
```
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

:::frame 
__Interpretation of Muliple Regression Coefficients__  

The parameters of a multiple regression model are:

+ $\beta_0$ (The intercept);
+ $\beta_1$ (The slope across values of $x_1$);
+ ...  
+ ...
+ $\beta_k$ (The slope across values of $x_k$);
+ $\sigma$ (The standard deviation of the errors).

<br>
You'll hear a lot of different ways that people explain multiple regression coefficients.  
For the model $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon$, the estimate $\hat \beta_1$ will often be reported as:  
  
the increase in $y$ for a one unit increase in $x_1$ when...

- holding the effect of $x_2$ constant.
- controlling for differences in $x_2$.
- partialling out the effects of $x_2$.
- holding $x_2$ equal. 
- accounting for effects of $x_2$. 

:::int
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(wb_mdl1)$coefficients
```

The coefficient `r round(coef(wb_mdl1)[2],2)` of weekly outdoor time for predicting wellbeing score says that among those with the same number of social interactions per week, those who have one additional hour of outdoor time tend to, on average, score `r round(coef(wb_mdl1)[2],2)` higher on the WEMWBS wellbeing scale. The multiple regression coefficient measures that average _conditional_ relationship.
:::

:::

`r qbegin("B6")`
:::frame
Just like the simple linear regression, when we estimate parameters from the available data, we have:

- A _fitted model_ (recall that the h$\hat{\textrm{a}}$ts are used to distinguish our _estimates_ from the _true unknown parameters_): 
$$
\widehat{Wellbeing} = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 \cdot Outdoor Time + \hat \beta_2 \cdot Social Interactions
$$
- And we have the residuals $\hat \epsilon = y - \hat y$ which are the deviations from the observed values and our model-predicted responses.  

:::

1. Extract *and interpret* the parameter estimates (the "coefficients") from your model.  
  (`summary()`, `coef()`, `$coefficients` etc will be useful here)  
2. Within what distance from the model predicted values (the regression surface) would we expect 95% of WEMWBS wellbeing scores to be? 
  (Either `sigma()` or part of the output from `summary()` will help you for this)  

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
coef(wb_mdl1)
```

- $\hat \beta_0$ = `r round(coef(wb_mdl1)[1],2)`, the estimated average wellbeing score associated with zero hours of outdoor time and zero social interactions per week.  
- $\hat \beta_1$ = `r round(coef(wb_mdl1)[2],2)`, the estimated increase in average wellbeing score associated with one hour increase in weekly outdoor time, _holding the number of social interactions constant_ (i.e., when the remaining explanatory variables are held at the same value or are fixed).
- $\hat \beta_2$ = `r round(coef(wb_mdl1)[3],2)`, the estimated increase in average wellbeing score associated with an additional social interaction per week (an increase of one), _holding weekly outdoor time constant_.  

```{r}
sigma(wb_mdl1)
```

The estimated standard deviation of the errors is $\hat \sigma$ = `r round(sigma(wb_mdl1),2)`. We would expect 95% of wellbeing scores to be within about `r round(sigma(wb_mdl1)*2,2)` ($2 \hat \sigma$) from the model fit.

# Before we go too far 

:::frame
So far, we have been fitting and interpreting our regression models. In each case, we first specified the model, then visually explored the marginal distributions and relationships of variables which would be used in the analysis. Then, once we fitted the model, we began to examine the fit by studying what the various parameter estimates represented, and the spread of the residuals. We saw these in the output of `summary()` of a model - they were shown in the parts of the output inside the red boxes in Figure \@ref(fig:mlroutput)). 

```{r mlroutput, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Multiple regression output in R, summary.lm(). Residuals and Coefficients highlighted"}

```

We also discussed drawing inferences using our model estimates, as well as using a model to make predictions. 
However, we should really not have done this prior to being satisfied that our model meets a certain set of assumptions.  All of the estimates, intervals and hypothesis tests (see Figure \@ref(fig:mlroutputhyp)) resulting from a regression analysis _assume_ a certain set of conditions have been met. Meeting these conditions is what allows us to generalise our findings beyond our sample (i.e., to the population).

__IMPORTANT!__

It may help to think of the sequence of steps involved in statistical modeling as:  
$$
\text{Choose} \rightarrow \text{Fit} \rightarrow \text{Assess} \rightarrow \text{Use}
$$
<br>
  
1. We explore/visualise our data and **Choose** our model specification.   
2. Then we **Fit** the model in R.  
3. Next, we **Assess** the fit, to ensure that it meets all the underlying assumptions?  
4. *Finally*, we **Use** our model to draw statistical inferences about the world, or to make predictions.  

**A general rule**  
<center>Do not **use** (draw inferences or predictions from) a model *before* you have **assessed** that the model satisfies the underlying assumptions</center>  

:::

## The LINE Mnemonic  

The assumptions of the linear model can be committed to memory using the **LINE** mnemonic:   
  
:::yellow  

+ **L**inearity: The relationship between $y$ and $x$ is linear.
+ **I**ndependence of errors: The error terms should be independent from one another.
+ **N**ormality: The errors $\epsilon$ are normally distributed
+ **E**qual variances ("Homoscedasticity"): The scale of the variability of the errors  $\epsilon$ is constant at all values of $x$.  

:::

When we fit a model, we evaluate many of these assumptions by looking at the *residuals*  
(the deviations from the observed values $y_i$ and the model estimated value $\hat y_i$).   
  
The residuals, $\hat \epsilon$ are our estimates of the actual unknown true error term $\epsilon$. These assumptions hold both for a regression model with a single predictor and for one with multiple predictors.




# Exercises: Assumptions & Diagnostics  
  
`r qbegin("C1")`
Create a new section heading for "Assumptions".    
Recall our the form of our model which we fitted and stored as `wb_mdl1`:  

$$ 
\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Outdoor Time} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Social Interactions} + \epsilon
$$

Wich we fitted in R using:
```{r}
wb_mdl1 <- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata)
```

**Note:** We have have forgone writing the `1` in `lm(y ~ 1 + x...`. The 1 just tells R that we want to estimate the Intercept, and it will do this by default even if we leave it out. 
`r qend()`

## Linearity  
:::frame
In simple linear regression with only one explanatory variable, we can assess linearity through a simple scatterplot of the outcome variable against the explanatory. In multiple regression, however, it becomes more necessary to rely on diagnostic plots of the model residuals. This is because we need to know whether the relations are linear between the outcome and each predictor _after accounting for the other predictors in the model._  

In order to assess this, we use **partial-residual plots** (also known as 'component-residual plots'). This is a plot with each explanatory variable $x_j$ on the x-axis, and **partial residuals** on the y-axis.

Partial residuals for a predictor $x_j$ are calculated as:
$$
\hat \epsilon + \hat \beta_j x_j
$$

**In R** we can easily create these plots for all predictors in the model by using the `crPlots()` function from the **car** package.  
:::

`r qbegin("C2")`
Create partial-residual plots for the `wb_mdl1` model.  
Remember to load the **car** package first. If it does not load correctly, it might mean that you have need to install it.

:::int
The smoother (the pink line) follows quite closely to a linear relationship (the dashed blue line), suggesting that the linearity assumption is met.  
:::

`r solend()`

## Equal variances (Homoscedasticity)  
:::frame
The equal variances assumption is that the error variance $\sigma^2$ is constant across values of the predictors $x_1$, ... $x_k$, and across values of the fitted values $\hat y$. This sometimes gets termed "Constant" vs "Non-constant" variance. Figures \@ref(fig:ncv1) & \@ref(fig:ncv2) shows what these look like visually. 

```{r ncv1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Non-constant variance for numeric and categorical x"}
library(patchwork)
n=1000
x <- runif(n, min = 0, max = 100)
y.increasing <- 3 + 0.2 * x + (1 + x / 25) * rnorm(n, sd = 3)
y.good <- 3 + 0.1 * x + rnorm(n, sd = 3)


lm.good <- lm(y.good ~ x)
lm.bad <-lm(y.increasing~x)

p1<-ggplot(NULL, aes(x=fitted(lm.bad), y=resid(lm.bad)))+
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  labs(title="Non-constant variance",subtitle="ncvTest p<.05",x="fitted",y="residuals")+
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())

p2<-ggplot(NULL, aes(x=fitted(lm.good), y=resid(lm.good)))+
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  labs(title="constant variance",subtitle="ncvTest p>.05",x="fitted",y="residuals")+
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())

p3<-ggplot(NULL, aes(x=fitted(lm.bad)<mean(fitted(lm.bad)), y=resid(lm.bad)))+
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  labs(x="fitted",y="residuals")+
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())

p4<-ggplot(NULL, aes(x=fitted(lm.good)<mean(fitted(lm.good)), y=resid(lm.good)))+
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  labs(x="fitted",y="residuals")+
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())


(p1 | p3 )
```

```{r ncv2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Constant variance for numeric and categorical x"}
(p2 | p4)
```

**In R** we can create plots of the _Pearson residuals_ against the predicted values $\hat y$ and against the predictors $x_1$, ... $x_k$ by using the `residualPlots()` function from the **car** package. This function also provides the results of a lack-of-fit test for each of these relationships (note when it is the fitted values $\hat y$ it gets called "Tukey's test").  

`ncvTest(model)` (also from the **car** package) performs a test against the alternative hypothesis that the error variance changes with the level of the fitted value (also known as the "Breusch-Pagan test"). $p >.05$ indicates that we do _not_ have evidence that the assumption has been violated.

You can use this plot to visually assess:

## Independence
:::frame
The "independence of errors" assumption is the condition that the errors do not have some underlying relationship which is causing them to influence one another. 
<br>
There are many sources of possible dependence, and often these are issues of study design. For example, we may have groups of observations in our data which we would expect to be related (e.g., multiple trials from the same participant). Our modelling strategy would need to take this into account.
<br>
One form of dependence is **autocorrelation** - this is when observations influence those adjacent to them. It is common in data for which *time* is a variable of interest (e.g, the humidity today is dependent upon the rainfall yesterday).  
<br>
**In R** we can test against the alternative hypothesis that there is autocorrelation in our errors using the `durbinWatsonTest()` (an abbreviated function `dwt()` is also available) in the **car** package.  

:::

`r qbegin("C5")`
Perform a test against the alternative hypothesis that there is autocorrelation in the error terms.

:::

## Normality of errors  
:::frame
The normality assumption is the condition that the errors $\epsilon$ are normally distributed. 

We can visually assess this condition through histograms, density plots, and quantile-quantile plots (QQplots) of our residuals $\hat \epsilon$.    
We can also perform a Shapiro-Wilk test against the alternative hypothesis that the residuals were not sampled from a normally distributed population. The `shapiro.test()` function in R. 

:::

`r qbegin("C6")`
Assess the normality assumption by producing a qqplot of the residuals (either manually or using `plot(model, which = ???)`), and conducting a Shapiro-Wilk test.  
  
Write a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to plots and/or formal tests where available.
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We can get the QQplot from one of the `plot(model)` plots: 
```{r}
plot(wb_mdl1, which = 2)
```
Or we can make our own:
```{r}
tibble(
  resids = residuals(wb_mdl1)
) %>% ggplot(aes(sample=resids))+
  geom_qq()+
  geom_qq_line()
```

```{r}
shapiro.test(residuals(wb_mdl1))
```

:::int 
The QQplot indicates that the residuals follow close to a normal distribution, although with evidence of heavier tails. A Shapiro-Wilk test failed to reject the null hypothesis that the residuals were drawn from a normally distributed population ($W = 0.95$, $p = .129$)

## Multicollinearity  
:::frame
For the linear model with multiple explanatory variables, we need to also think about **multicollinearity** - this is when two (or more) of the predictors in our regression model are moderately or highly correlated.  
Recall our interpretation of multiple regression coefficients as  
<center>"the effect of $x_1$ on $y$ when _holding the values of $x_2$, $x_3$, ... $x_k$ constant_"</center>  
This interpretation falls down if predictors are highly correlated because if, e.g., predictors $x_1$ and $x_2$ are highly correlated, then changing the value of $x_1$ necessarily entails a change the value of $x_2$ meaning that it no longer makes sense to talk about _holding $x_2$ constant._  
<br>
We can assess multicollinearity using the **variance inflation factor (VIF)**, which for a given predictor $x_j$ is calculated as:  
$$
VIF_j = \frac{1}{1-R_j^2} \\
$$
Where $R_j^2$ is the coefficient of determination (the R-squared) resulting from a regression of $x_j$ on to all the other predictors in the model ($x_j = x_1 + ... x_k + \epsilon$).  
The more highly correlated $x_j$ is with other predictors, the bigger $R_j^2$ becomes, and thus the bigger $VIF_j$ becomes.  
<br>
The square root of VIF indicates how much the SE of the coefficient has been inflated due to multicollinearity. For example, if the VIF of a predictor variable were 4.6 ($\sqrt{4.6} = 2.1$), then the standard error of the coefficient of that predictor is 2.1 times larger than if the predictor had zero correlation with the other predictor variables. Suggested cut-offs for VIF are varied. Some suggest 10, others 5. Define what you will consider an acceptable value _prior_ to calculating it.   
<br>
**In R**, the `vif()` function from the **car** package will provide VIF values for each predictor in your model.

## Individual cases  

:::frame
We have seen in the case of the simple linear regression that individual cases in our data can influence our model more than others. We know about:  

+ **Regression outliers:** A large residual $\hat \epsilon_i$ - i.e., a big discrepancy between their predicted y-value and their observed y-value.  
    + **Standardised residuals:** For residual $\hat \epsilon_i$, divide by the estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals. In R, the `rstandard()` function will give you these
    + **Studentised residuals:** For residual $\hat \epsilon_i$, divide by the estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals excluding case $i$. In R, the `rstudent()` function will give you these. Values $>|2|$ (greater in magnitude than two) are considered potential outliers.  
+ **High leverage cases:** These are cases which have considerable _potential_ to influence the regression model (e.g., cases with an unusual combination of predictor values). 
    + **Hat values:** are used to assess leverage. In R, The `hatvalues()` function will retrieve these.  
    Hat values of more than $2 \bar{h}$ (2 times the average hat value) are considered high leverage. $\bar{h}$ is calculated as $\frac{k + 1}{n}$, where $k$ is the number of predictors, and $n$ is the sample size.  
+ **High influence cases:** When a case has high leverage *and* is an outlier, it will have a large influence on the regression model. 
    + **Cook's Distance:** combines *leverage* (hatvalues) with *outlying-ness* to capture influence. In R, the `cooks.distance()` function will provide these.  
    A suggested Cook's Distance cut-off is $\frac{4}{n-k-1}$, where $k$ is the number of predictors, and $n$ is the sample size.   

:::

`r qbegin("C8")`
Create a new tibble which contains:  

1. The original variables from the model (Hint, what does `wb_mdl1$model` give you?)
2. The fitted values from the model $\hat y$  
3. The residuals $\hat epsilon$
4. The studentised residuals
5. The hat values
6. The Cook's Distance values. 

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
mdl_diagnost <- 
  tibble(
  wb_mdl1$model,
  fitted = fitted(wb_mdl1),
  resid = residuals(wb_mdl1),
  studres = rstudent(wb_mdl1),
  hats = hatvalues(wb_mdl1),
  cooksd = cooks.distance(wb_mdl1)
)
```

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("C9")`
Looking at the studentised residuals, are there any outliers?  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Recall from the lectures, studentised residuals of $>2$ or $< -2$ indicate potential outlyingness.  

We can ask R whether the *absolute* values are $>2$:
```{r}
abs(mdl_diagnost$studres) > 2
```

We could *filter* our newly created tibble to these observations:
```{r}
mdl_diagnost %>% 
  filter(abs(studres)>2)
```
There are zero rows. 

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("C10")`
Looking at the hat values, are there any observations with high leverage?  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
For our model, the average hat value $\bar h$ is:  
$$
\bar h = \frac{k+1}{n} = \frac{2+1}{32} = \frac{3}{32} = 0.094
$$

We can ask whether any of observations have hat values which are greater than $2 \times \bar h$:

```{r}
mdl_diagnost %>%
  filter(hats > (2*0.094))
```

Note that quite a few observations (`r sum(mdl_diagnost$hats > (2*0.094))`) have high leverage. 

`r solend()`
  
`r qbegin("C11")`  
Looking at the Cook's Distance values, are there any highly influential points?  
(You can also display these graphically using `plot(model, which = 4)` and `plot(model, which = 5)`). 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
For our model, a proposed cut-off for Cook's Distance is:
$$
D_{cutoff} = \frac{4}{n-k-1} = \frac{4}{32 - 2 - 1} = \frac{4}{29} = 0.138
$$

There are no observations which have a high influence on our model estimates:
```{r}
mdl_diagnost %>%
  filter(cooksd > 0.138)
```

## Other influence.measures()

:::frame

Alongside Cook's Distance, we can examine the extent to which model estimates and predictions are affected when an entire case is dropped from the dataset and the model is refitted.  

+ **DFFit:** the change in the predicted value at the $i^{th}$ observation with and without the $i^{th}$ observation is included in the regression.  
+ **DFbeta:**  the change in a specific coefficient with and without the $i^{th}$ observation is included in the regression.  
+ **DFbetas:**  the change in a specific coefficient divided by the standard error, with and without the $i^{th}$ observation is included in the regression.  
+ **COVRATIO:** measures the effect of an observation on the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates. In simpler terms, it captures an observation's influence on standard errors. Values which are $>1+\frac{3(k+1)}{n}$ or $<1-\frac{3(k+1)}{n}$ are considered as having strong influence.  

:::


`r qbegin("C12")`

Use the function `influence.measures()` to extract these delete-1 measures of influence.  

Try plotting the distributions of some of these measures.  

**Tip:** the function `influence.measures()` returns an `infl`-type object. To plot this, we need to find a way to extract the actual numbers from it.  
What do you think `names(influence.measures(wb_mdl1))` shows you? How can we use `influence.measures(wb_mdl1)$<insert name here>` to extract the matrix of numbers?  


`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
influence.measures(wb_mdl1)
```
  
Let's plot the distribution of COVRATIO statistics.  
Recall that values which are $>1+\frac{3(k+1)}{n}$ or $<1-\frac{3(k+1)}{n}$ are considered as having strong influence.  
For our model:
$$
1 \pm \frac{3(k+1)}{n} \quad = \quad 1 \pm\frac{3(2+1)}{32} \quad = \quad 1\pm \frac{9}{32} \quad = \quad 1\pm0.28
$$

The "infmat" bit of an `infl`-type object contains the numbers. To use it with ggplot, we will need to turn it into a dataframe (`as.data.frame()`), or a tibble (`as_tibble()`):   
```{r}
infdata <- influence.measures(wb_mdl1)$infmat %>%
  as_tibble()

ggplot(data = infdata, aes(x = cov.r)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1-0.28)))+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1+0.28)))
```

It looks like a few observations may be having quite a high influence here. This is perhaps not that surprising as we only have 32 datapoints.
