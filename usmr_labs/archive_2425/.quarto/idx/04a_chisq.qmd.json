The past few weeks have focused on tests for __numeric__ outcome variables, where we have been concerned with the mean of that variable (e.g. whether that mean is different from some specific value, or whether it is different between two groups). \nWe now turn to investigate tests for __categorical__ outcome variables. \n\nWhen studying categorical variables, we tend to be interested in __counts__ (or \"frequencies\"), and these can be presented in tables:\n\n```{r}\ntimehands <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/timehands.csv\") |>\n  mutate(\n    isLeft = ifelse(handed==\"left\", \"left\", \"other\")\n  )\n\ntable(timehands$isLeft) \n```\n\n# Binomials\n\nIf we just have two categories, then our frequency table really can be summarised as a proportion. E.g., \"the proportion who are left-handed\". We know that the other number (the proportion who are *not* left-handed) *has* to be 1-the proportion who _are_:  \n```{r}\ntable(timehands$isLeft) |>\n  prop.table() # turn into proportions\n```\n\nReally, these proportions are \"the number of $x$'s out of $n$ things\", and we often see this written as \"$k$ successes in $n$ trials\". The reason for this is because it is built upon counting up a series of independent binary observations. The distribution of \"$k$ successes in $n$ trials\" is known as the **Binomial distribution**. \n\nAs an example, if we think of what probability distribution governs a single coin flip, it would look something like the Left hand plot in @fig-bernbin. But if we are instead considering what governs the behaviour of \"number of tails in 5 coin flips\" then our probabilities of each possible outcome look like the Right hand panel.   \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-bernbin\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\n#| fig-height: 4\n#| fig-cap: \"Left: A 'Bernoulli distribution' - the probability for a single observation (e.g. a single coin flip) with a binary outcome, where the probability of 'success' (i.e. Tails) is 0.5.

A \"distribution\" here is just a way of expressing the probability of seeing different values, and we can write it mathematically if we are that way inclined:  \n\n$$\nP(k) = p^k(1-p)^{1-k} \\qquad \\textrm{for } k \\in \\{0,1\\}\n$$\nThis looks a bit nonsensical at first, but it's actually just a complicated way of saying \"the probability of seeing $k = 1$ is the probability that $k = 1$\".  \nFor instance, if we had a coin-flip, and we said that Tails is our \"success\" (and we give it the value 1) then the probability of seeing Heads and of seeing Tails is: \n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\textrm{Probability of failure (Heads)} = P(0) &= 0.5^0(1-0.5)^{1-0} \\\\\n&= 0.5^0(0.5)^{1} \\\\\n&= 0.5 \\\\\n\\textrm{Probability of success (Tails)} = P(1) &= 0.5^1(1-0.5)^{1-1} \\\\\n&= 0.5^1(0.5)^{0} \\\\\n&= 0.5\n\\end{align}\n$$\nWhen we move to thinking about the number of success in a set of trials, there we have to factor in the different ways in which we could see that number of success. For instance, if we had 3 coin flips, we could either see 0 Tails, 1 Tails, 2 Tails, or 3 Tails. There is only _one_ way we could see \"0 Tails\", but there are 3 different ways we could see \"1 Tails\" - we could have THH, HTH, or HHT!  \n\nThe probability of $k$ successes in $n$ trials is the Binomial distribution, and is written as:\n \n$$\nP(k) = {n \\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\n$$\nWhich can be read as: the probability of seeing $k$ successes is \"the number of ways in which we could see k successes in n trials\" (this is the ${n \\choose k}$ bit) multiplied by the probability of success in a single trial to the power of $k$, multiplied by the probability of failure in a single trial to the power of $n-k$.  \n\nTo make more sense, let's put it in the context of our \"1 Tails in 3 coin flips\". The coin is fair, so the probability of a single Tails is 0.5 (so below we replace $p$ with 0.5), and we saw just above that there are 3 ways that we can get 1 success in 3 trials (so the calculation ${3 \\choose 1}$ becomes 3)  \n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Probabiltiy of 1 Tails in 3 flips} = P(1) &= {3 \\choose 1}0.5^1(1-0.5)^{3-1} \\\\\n&= {3 \\choose 1}0.5^1(0.5)^{2} \\\\\n&= {3 \\choose 1}0.5 \\times 0.25 \\\\\n&= {3 \\choose 1} 0.125 \\\\\n&= 3 \\times 0.125 \\\\\n&= 0.375 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWe can actually check this in R using a handy function: \n```{r}\ndbinom(x = 1, size = 3, prob = 0.5)\n```\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\nReturning to \"the proportion of people who are left-handed\", the internet (and everything on there is true, of course) tells me that 10% of the population is left-handed. As we have 100 people in our dataset, our expectation of what we are likely to see from samples of 100 people (if the probability of being left-handed is 0.10) therefore looks something like @fig-exp100.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-exp100\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\n#| fig-height: 4\n#| fig-cap: \"Expected distribution of 'number of left-handed people out of 100', assuming the true probability of being left-handed is 0.1\"\ntibble(response = 0:100, prob = sapply(0:100,\\(x) dbinom(x,100,.1))) %>%\nggplot(., aes(x=response, y=prob))+\n  geom_point(size=3)+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=response, xend=response, y=0,yend=prob),lty=\"dotted\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(\"numbers of left-handers in n=100\\nwhere p(Left)=0.1\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(\"probability\")+\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\nMuch like the null hypothesis testing we have seen already concerning whether our observed mean is different from some hypothesised value (see [3B #one-sample-t-test](03b_inference2.html#one-sample-t-test){target=\"_blank\"}), we can conduct a test of whether our observed sample proportion (12/100 = 0.12) is likely to have been drawn from a population where the true probability is 0.1:  \n\n```{r}\ntable(timehands$isLeft)\n```\n\nEither of these will work, and both will produce the same output:\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nbinom.test(x = 12, n = 100, p = 0.1)\ntable(timehands$isLeft) |> binom.test(p = 0.1)\n```\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nbinom.test(x = 12, n = 100, p = 0.1)\n```\n\nIn this case, the p-value is >.05^[the conventional $\\alpha$ level used in psychology], so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the probability of being left-handed is 0.1.  \n\n# More than 2 categories\n\nWhile the binomials capture the distribution of a series of binary trials, what happens when we are interested in something that _isn't_ binary? There are lots of categorical variables that have more than two possible values. \nFor example, handedness isn't as simple as \"Left vs Others\", we might have 3 categories: \n\n```{r}\ntable(timehands$handed)\n```\n\nFurthermore, we might have a slightly more nuanced question that involves two variables, rather than just one! For instance, we might be interested in whether left/right/ambidextrous proportions are different across people who prefer the morning or night.  \nIn this case, with 2 variables, we have a 2-dimensional table (also referred to as a 'contingency table'):\n```{r}\ntable(timehands$handed, timehands$ampm)\n```\n\nSo we want to be able to perform tests to examine things such as:  \n\nb) how likely we are to see our sample frequencies in a single categorical variable, if some some hypothesised null distribution were true (e.g. how likely are we to see the numbers of left/right/ambi people in our sample if in bigger population we expect a 1/3 chance of each?)  \nc) how likely we are to see our sample frequencies across two categorical variables, if these variables are _independent_ in the population. (e.g. how likely are we to see the counts in the 2x2 table above, if being left/right/ambi has _nothing to do with_ whether you are a morning or night person).  \n\nThe test-statistics for these sort of tests (denoted $\\chi^2$, spelled *chi-square*, pronounced \"kai-square\") are obtained by adding up the standardized squared deviations in each cell of a table of frequencies:  \n\n$$\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{all\\ cells} \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}}\n$$\nwhere:\n\n- $\\text{Observed}$ = observed count for a cell\n- $\\text{Expected}$ = expected count for a cell\n\n\nJust like the $t$-statistics we calculate follow $t$-distributions, the $\\chi^2$-statistics follow $\\chi^2$ distributions! If you look carefully at the formula above, it can never be negative (because the value on top of the fraction is squared, and so is always positive). \nFor a given cell of the table, if we observe exactly what we expect, then $\\text{(Observed - Expected)}^2$ becomes zero. The further away the observed count is from the expected count, the larger it becomes.  \n\nThis means that under the null hypothesis, larger values are less likely. And the shape of our $\\chi^2$ distributions follow this logic. They have higher probability for small values, getting progressively less likely for large values. $\\chi^2$-distributions _also_ have a degrees of freedom, because with more cells in a table, there are more chances for random deviations between \"observed and expected\" to come in, meaning we are more likely to see higher test statistics when we have more cells in the table (and therefore more degrees of freedom). You can see the distribution of $\\chi^2$ statistics with different degrees of freedom in @fig-chidist1 below.  \n```{r}\n#| label: fig-chidist1\n#| echo: false\n#| fig.cap: \"Chi-Square Distributions\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Chi-square_pdf.svg/1200px-Chi-square_pdf.svg.png\")\n```\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n\n# $\\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Test\n\n\n:::statbox\n\n__Purpose__\n\nThe $\\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Test is typically used to investigate whether observed sample proportions are consistent with an hypothesis about the proportional breakdown of the various categories in the population.  \n\n- __Examples:__\n  - Do 20% of the adult population suffer from some form of depression? \n  - Are people equally likely to be born on any of the seven days of the week?  \n  - Are 25% of [Smarties](https://g.co/kgs/wr3MCd){target=\"_blank\"} brown?  \n  - Are 2/3 of people 'dog people' and 1/3 of people 'cat people'?  \n  \n__Assumptions__\n\n1.

With an $\\alpha = 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis that the proportion of people suffering from different levels of depression are the same as those indicated previously in 2019.\n\n:::int\n$\\chi^2$ goodness of fit test indicated that the observed proportions of people suffering from no/mild/moderate/severe depression were significantly different ($\\chi^2(3)=9.96, p = .019$) from those expected under the distribution suggested from a 2019 study (80%/12%/4%/4%).\n:::\n\nWe can examine where the biggest deviations from the hypothesised distribution are by examining the 'residuals': \n```{r}\nchisq.test(table(depdata$dep), p = c(.12, .04, .8, .04))$residuals\n```\nThis matches with what we see when we look at the table of counts. With $n=1000$, under our 2019 distribution, we would expect 800 to have no depression, 120 mild, 40 moderate, and 40 severe.   \n```{r}\ntable(depdata$dep)\n```\n\nThe difference in the moderate \"observed - expected\" is 6, and the difference in the \"no depression\" is 29. But these are not comparable, because really the 6 is a much bigger amount of the expected for that category than 29 is for the no depression category. The residuals are a way of standardising these.  \n\nThey are calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{residual} = \\frac{\\text{observed} - \\text{expected}}{\\sqrt{expected}}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Step-by-step calculations\n\nFirst we calculate the observed counts: \n```{r}\ndepdata |> \n  count(dep)\n```\nLet's add to this the expected counts:  \n```{r}\ndepdata |> \n  count(dep) |>\n  mutate(\n    expected = c(.12, .04, .8, .04)*1000\n  )\n```\n\nHow do we measure how far the observed counts are from the expected counts under the null? If we simply subtracted the expected counts from the observed counts and then add them up, you will get 0. Instead, we will square the differences between the observed and expected counts, and then add them up.\n\nOne issue, however, remains to be solved. A squared difference between observed and expected counts of 100 has a different weight in these two scenarios:\n\n__Scenario 1:__ $O = 30$ and $E = 20$ leads to a squared difference $(O - E)^2 = 10^2 = 100$.  \n__Scenario 2:__ $O = 3000$ and $E = 2990$ leads to a squared difference $(O - E)^2 = 10^2 = 100$\n\nHowever, it is clear that a squared difference of 100 in Scenario 1 is much more substantial than a squared difference of 100 in Scenario 2. It is for this reason that we divide the squared differences by the the expected counts to \"standardize\" the squared deviation.\n\n$$\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i} \\frac{(\\text{Observed}_i - \\text{Expected}_i)^2}{\\text{Expected}_i}\n$$\n\nWe can calculate each part of the equation:  \n```{r}\ndepdata |> \n  count(dep) |>\n  mutate(\n    expected = c(.12, .04, .8, .04)*1000,\n    sq_diff = (n - expected)^2,\n    std_sq_diff = sq_diff/expected\n  )\n```\n\nThe test-statistic $\\chi^2$ is obtained by adding up all the standardized squared deviations:  \n```{r}\ndepdata |> \n  count(dep) |>\n  mutate(\n    expected = c(.12, .04, .8, .04)*1000,\n    sq_diff = (n - expected)^2,\n    std_sq_diff = sq_diff/expected\n  ) |> \n  summarise(\n    chi = sum(std_sq_diff)\n  )\n```\n\nThe p-value for a $\\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Test is computed using a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $df = \\text{nr categories} - 1$.  \nWe calculate our p-value by using `pchisq()` and we have 4 levels of depression, so $df = 4-1 = 3$.  \n\n```{r}\npchisq(9.959583, df=3, lower.tail=FALSE)\n```\n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# $\\chi^2$ Test of Independence  \n\n:::statbox\n__Purpose__\n\nThe $\\chi^2$ Test of Independence is used to determine whether or not there is a significant association between two categorical variables.

With an $\\alpha=.05$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between depression severity and family history of depression.  \n\n\n:::int\nA $\\chi^2$ test of independence indicated no significant association between severity and family history ($\\chi^2(3)=1.07, p=.785$), suggesting that a participants' severity of depression was not dependent on whether or not they had a family history of depression.  \n:::\n\nWe can see the expected and observed counts:\n```{r}\nchisq.test(table(depdata$dep, depdata$fam_hist))$expected\nchisq.test(table(depdata$dep, depdata$fam_hist))$observed\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Step-by-step calculations\n\nWe have our observed table:\n```{r}\ntable(depdata$dep, depdata$fam_hist)\n```\nTo work out our _expected_ counts, we have to do something a bit tricky. \nLet's look at the variables independently:  \n```{r}\ntable(depdata$fam_hist)\ntable(depdata$dep)\n```\nWith $\\frac{315}{315+685} = 0.315$ of the sample having a family history, then _if depression severity is independent of family history,_ we would expect that 0.315 of each severity group to have a family history of depression. For example, for the mild depression, with 143 people, we would expect $143 \\times 0.315 = 45.045$ people in that group to have a family history of depression.  \n\nFor a given cell of the table we can calculate the expected count as $\\text{row total} \\times \\frac{\\text{column total}}{\\text{samplesize}}$.  \nOr, quickly in R:  \n```{r}\nobs <- table(depdata$dep, depdata$fam_hist)\nexp <- rowSums(obs) %o% colSums(obs) / sum(obs)\nexp\n```\nNow that we have our table of observed counts, and our table of expected counts, we can actually fit these into our formula to calculate the test statistic: \n```{r}\nsum ( (obs - exp)^2 / exp )\n```\nThe p-value is computed using a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $df = (\\text{nr rows} - 1) \\times (\\text{nr columns} - 1)$.  \n\nWhy is this? Well, remember that the degrees of freedom is the number of values that are *free to vary* as we estimate parameters. In a table such as the one below, where we have 4 rows and 2 columns, the degrees of freedom is the number of cells in the table that can vary before we can simply calculate the values of the other cells (where we're constrained by the need to sum to our row/column totals).  \n\nWe have 4 rows, and 2 columns, so $df = (4-1) \\times (2-1) = 3$.  \n\n```{r}\npchisq(1.066686, df = 3, lower.tail=FALSE)\n```\n\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\n#| include: false\nsource('assets/setup.R')\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nset.seed(017)\n```\n\n:::lo\nThis reading:  \n\n- What are the basic hypothesis tests that we can conduct when we are interested in variables that have categories instead of numbers?  \n  - Tests of a proportion\n  - Tests of the distribution of a single categorical variable\n  - Tests of the relationship between two categorical variables\n\n\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nset.seed(257)\ntimehands <- expand_grid(\n  handed = c(\"left\",\"right\",\"ambi\"),\n  ampm = c(\"morning\",\"night\")\n) |>\n  mutate(\n    n = ceiling(c(c(.8, .2)*.1, c(.5,.5)*.84, c(.2,.8)*.03) * 100)\n  ) |> uncount(n) |>\n  sample_n(n()) |> mutate(isLeft = ifelse(handed==\"left\",\"left\",\"other\"))\n# write_csv(timehands,\"../../data/timehands.csv\")\n```\n\nJust like we did with the various types of $t$-test, we're going to continue with some more brief explainers of different basic statistical tests. The past few weeks have focused on tests for __numeric__ outcome variables, where we have been concerned with the mean of that variable (e.g. whether that mean is different from some specific value, or whether it is different between two groups). \nWe now turn to investigate tests for __categorical__ outcome variables. \n\nWhen studying categorical variables, we tend to be interested in __counts__ (or \"frequencies\"), and these can be presented in tables:\n\n```{r}\ntimehands <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/timehands.csv\") |>\n  mutate(\n    isLeft = ifelse(handed==\"left\", \"left\", \"other\")\n  )\n\ntable(timehands$isLeft) \n```\n\n# Binomials\n\nIf we just have two categories, then our frequency table really can be summarised as a proportion. E.g., \"the proportion who are left-handed\". We know that the other number (the proportion who are *not* left-handed) *has* to be 1-the proportion who _are_:  \n```{r}\ntable(timehands$isLeft) |>\n  prop.table() # turn into proportions\n```\n\nReally, these proportions are \"the number of $x$'s out of $n$ things\", and we often see this written as \"$k$ successes in $n$ trials\". The reason for this is because it is built upon counting up a series of independent binary observations. The distribution of \"$k$ successes in $n$ trials\" is known as the **Binomial distribution**. \n\nAs an example, if we think of what probability distribution governs a single coin flip, it would look something like the Left hand plot in @fig-bernbin. But if we are instead considering what governs the behaviour of \"number of tails in 5 coin flips\" then our probabilities of each possible outcome look like the Right hand panel.   \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-bernbin\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\n#| fig-height: 4\n#| fig-cap: \"Left: A 'Bernoulli distribution' - the probability for a single observation (e.g. a single coin flip) with a binary outcome, where the probability of 'success' (i.e. Tails) is 0.5.

A \"distribution\" here is just a way of expressing the probability of seeing different values, and we can write it mathematically if we are that way inclined:  \n\n$$\nP(k) = p^k(1-p)^{1-k} \\qquad \\textrm{for } k \\in \\{0,1\\}\n$$\nThis looks a bit nonsensical at first, but it's actually just a complicated way of saying \"the probability of seeing $k = 1$ is the probability that $k = 1$\".  \nFor instance, if we had a coin-flip, and we said that Tails is our \"success\" (and we give it the value 1) then the probability of seeing Heads and of seeing Tails is: \n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\textrm{Probability of failure (Heads)} = P(0) &= 0.5^0(1-0.5)^{1-0} \\\\\n&= 0.5^0(0.5)^{1} \\\\\n&= 0.5 \\\\\n\\textrm{Probability of success (Tails)} = P(1) &= 0.5^1(1-0.5)^{1-1} \\\\\n&= 0.5^1(0.5)^{0} \\\\\n&= 0.5\n\\end{align}\n$$\nWhen we move to thinking about the number of success in a set of trials, there we have to factor in the different ways in which we could see that number of success. For instance, if we had 3 coin flips, we could either see 0 Tails, 1 Tails, 2 Tails, or 3 Tails. There is only _one_ way we could see \"0 Tails\", but there are 3 different ways we could see \"1 Tails\" - we could have THH, HTH, or HHT!  \n\nThe probability of $k$ successes in $n$ trials is the Binomial distribution, and is written as:\n \n$$\nP(k) = {n \\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\n$$\nWhich can be read as: the probability of seeing $k$ successes is \"the number of ways in which we could see k successes in n trials\" (this is the ${n \\choose k}$ bit) multiplied by the probability of success in a single trial to the power of $k$, multiplied by the probability of failure in a single trial to the power of $n-k$.  \n\nTo make more sense, let's put it in the context of our \"1 Tails in 3 coin flips\". The coin is fair, so the probability of a single Tails is 0.5 (so below we replace $p$ with 0.5), and we saw just above that there are 3 ways that we can get 1 success in 3 trials (so the calculation ${3 \\choose 1}$ becomes 3)  \n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Probabiltiy of 1 Tails in 3 flips} = P(1) &= {3 \\choose 1}0.5^1(1-0.5)^{3-1} \\\\\n&= {3 \\choose 1}0.5^1(0.5)^{2} \\\\\n&= {3 \\choose 1}0.5 \\times 0.25 \\\\\n&= {3 \\choose 1} 0.125 \\\\\n&= 3 \\times 0.125 \\\\\n&= 0.375 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWe can actually check this in R using a handy function: \n```{r}\ndbinom(x = 1, size = 3, prob = 0.5)\n```\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\nReturning to \"the proportion of people who are left-handed\", the internet (and everything on there is true, of course) tells me that 10% of the population is left-handed. As we have 100 people in our dataset, our expectation of what we are likely to see from samples of 100 people (if the probability of being left-handed is 0.10) therefore looks something like @fig-exp100.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-exp100\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\n#| fig-height: 4\n#| fig-cap: \"Expected distribution of 'number of left-handed people out of 100', assuming the true probability of being left-handed is 0.1\"\ntibble(response = 0:100, prob = sapply(0:100,\\(x) dbinom(x,100,.1))) %>%\nggplot(., aes(x=response, y=prob))+\n  geom_point(size=3)+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=response, xend=response, y=0,yend=prob),lty=\"dotted\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(\"numbers of left-handers in n=100\\nwhere p(Left)=0.1\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(\"probability\")+\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\nMuch like the null hypothesis testing we have seen already concerning whether our observed mean is different from some hypothesised value (see [3B #one-sample-t-test](03b_inference2.html#one-sample-t-test){target=\"_blank\"}), we can conduct a test of whether our observed sample proportion (12/100 = 0.12) is likely to have been drawn from a population where the true probability is 0.1:  \n\n```{r}\ntable(timehands$isLeft)\n```\n\nEither of these will work, and both will produce the same output:\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nbinom.test(x = 12, n = 100, p = 0.1)\ntable(timehands$isLeft) |> binom.test(p = 0.1)\n```\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nbinom.test(x = 12, n = 100, p = 0.1)\n```\n\nIn this case, the p-value is >.05^[the conventional $\\alpha$ level used in psychology], so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the probability of being left-handed is 0.1.  \n\n# More than 2 categories\n\nWhile the binomials capture the distribution of a series of binary trials, what happens when we are interested in something that _isn't_ binary? There are lots of categorical variables that have more than two possible values. \nFor example, handedness isn't as simple as \"Left vs Others\", we might have 3 categories: \n\n```{r}\ntable(timehands$handed)\n```\n\nFurthermore, we might have a slightly more nuanced question that involves two variables, rather than just one! For instance, we might be interested in whether left/right/ambidextrous proportions are different across people who prefer the morning or night.  \nIn this case, with 2 variables, we have a 2-dimensional table (also referred to as a 'contingency table'):\n```{r}\ntable(timehands$handed, timehands$ampm)\n```\n\nSo we want to be able to perform tests to examine things such as:  \n\nb) how likely we are to see our sample frequencies in a single categorical variable, if some some hypothesised null distribution were true (e.g. how likely are we to see the numbers of left/right/ambi people in our sample if in bigger population we expect a 1/3 chance of each?)  \nc) how likely we are to see our sample frequencies across two categorical variables, if these variables are _independent_ in the population. (e.g. how likely are we to see the counts in the 2x2 table above, if being left/right/ambi has _nothing to do with_ whether you are a morning or night person).  \n\nThe test-statistics for these sort of tests (denoted $\\chi^2$, spelled *chi-square*, pronounced \"kai-square\") are obtained by adding up the standardized squared deviations in each cell of a table of frequencies:  \n\n$$\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{all\\ cells} \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}}\n$$\nwhere:\n\n- $\\text{Observed}$ = observed count for a cell\n- $\\text{Expected}$ = expected count for a cell\n\n\nJust like the $t$-statistics we calculate follow $t$-distributions, the $\\chi^2$-statistics follow $\\chi^2$ distributions! If you look carefully at the formula above, it can never be negative (because the value on top of the fraction is squared, and so is always positive). \nFor a given cell of the table, if we observe exactly what we expect, then $\\text{(Observed - Expected)}^2$ becomes zero. The further away the observed count is from the expected count, the larger it becomes.  \n\nThis means that under the null hypothesis, larger values are less likely. And the shape of our $\\chi^2$ distributions follow this logic. They have higher probability for small values, getting progressively less likely for large values. $\\chi^2$-distributions _also_ have a degrees of freedom, because with more cells in a table, there are more chances for random deviations between \"observed and expected\" to come in, meaning we are more likely to see higher test statistics when we have more cells in the table (and therefore more degrees of freedom). You can see the distribution of $\\chi^2$ statistics with different degrees of freedom in @fig-chidist1 below.  \n```{r}\n#| label: fig-chidist1\n#| echo: false\n#| fig.cap: \"Chi-Square Distributions\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Chi-square_pdf.svg/1200px-Chi-square_pdf.svg.png\")\n```\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n\n# $\\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Test\n\n\n:::statbox\n\n__Purpose__\n\nThe $\\chi^2$ Goodness of Fit Test is typically used to investigate whether observed sample proportions are consistent with an hypothesis about the proportional breakdown of the various categories in the population.  \n\n- __Examples:__\n  - Do 20% of the adult population suffer from some form of depression? \n  - Are people equally likely to be born on any of the seven days of the week?  \n  - Are 25% of [Smarties](https://g.co/kgs/wr3MCd){target=\"_blank\"} brown?  \n  - Are 2/3 of people 'dog people' and 1/3 of people 'cat people'?  \n  \n__Assumptions__\n\n1.

If we simply subtracted the expected counts from the observed counts and then add them up, you will get 0. Instead, we will square the differences between the observed and expected counts, and then add them up.\n\nOne issue, however, remains to be solved. A squared difference between observed and expected counts of 100 has a different weight in these two scenarios:\n\n__Scenario 1:__ $O = 30$ and $E = 20$ leads to a squared difference $(O - E)^2 = 10^2 = 100$.  \n__Scenario 2:__ $O = 3000$ and $E = 2990$ leads to a squared difference $(O - E)^2 = 10^2 = 100$\n\nHowever, it is clear that a squared difference of 100 in Scenario 1 is much more substantial than a squared difference of 100 in Scenario 2.

We don't need to give it any hypothesised proportions here - it will work them out based on the null hypothesis that the two variables are independent.  \n\n```{r}\nchisq.test(table(depdata$dep, depdata$fam_hist))\n```\nIf there was no association between depression severity and having a family history of depression, then the probability that we would obtain a test statistic this large (or larger) by random chance alone is 0.79. With an $\\alpha=.05$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between depression severity and family history of depression.  \n\n\n:::int\nA $\\chi^2$ test of independence indicated no significant association between severity and family history ($\\chi^2(3)=1.07, p=.785$), suggesting that a participants' severity of depression was not dependent on whether or not they had a family history of depression.  \n:::\n\nWe can see the expected and observed counts:\n```{r}\nchisq.test(table(depdata$dep, depdata$fam_hist))$expected\nchisq.test(table(depdata$dep, depdata$fam_hist))$observed\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Step-by-step calculations\n\nWe have our observed table:\n```{r}\ntable(depdata$dep, depdata$fam_hist)\n```\nTo work out our _expected_ counts, we have to do something a bit tricky. \nLet's look at the variables independently:  \n```{r}\ntable(depdata$fam_hist)\ntable(depdata$dep)\n```\nWith $\\frac{315}{315+685} = 0.315$ of the sample having a family history, then _if depression severity is independent of family history,_ we would expect that 0.315 of each severity group to have a family history of depression. For example, for the mild depression, with 143 people, we would expect $143 \\times 0.315 = 45.045$ people in that group to have a family history of depression.  \n\nFor a given cell of the table we can calculate the expected count as $\\text{row total} \\times \\frac{\\text{column total}}{\\text{samplesize}}$.  \nOr, quickly in R:  \n```{r}\nobs <- table(depdata$dep, depdata$fam_hist)\nexp <- rowSums(obs) %o% colSums(obs) / sum(obs)\nexp\n```\nNow that we have our table of observed counts, and our table of expected counts, we can actually fit these into our formula to calculate the test statistic: \n```{r}\nsum ( (obs - exp)^2 / exp )\n```\nThe p-value is computed using a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $df = (\\text{nr rows} - 1) \\times (\\text{nr columns} - 1)$.  \n\nWhy is this? Well, remember that the degrees of freedom is the number of values that are *free to vary* as we estimate parameters. In a table such as the one below, where we have 4 rows and 2 columns, the degrees of freedom is the number of cells in the table that can vary before we can simply calculate the values of the other cells (where we're constrained by the need to sum to our row/column totals).  \n\nWe have 4 rows, and 2 columns, so $df = (4-1) \\times (2-1) = 3$.  \n\n```{r}\npchisq(1.066686, df = 3, lower.tail=FALSE)\n```\n\n:::"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"include-in-header":["assets/toggling.html",{"text":"<link
