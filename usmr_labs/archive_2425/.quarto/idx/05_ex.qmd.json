She recruited 50 healthy adults, and collected data on the Total Sleep Time (TST) over the course of a seven day period via sleep-tracking devices.  \nAt the end of the seven day period, participants completed a Daytime Functioning (DTF) questionnaire. This involved participants rating their agreement with ten statements (see @tbl-sleepitems). Agreement was measured on a scale from 1-5. An overall score of daytime functioning can be calculated by:  \n\n1. reversing the scores for items 4,5 and 6 (because those items reflect agreement with _positive_ statements, whereas the other ones are agreement with _negative_ statement);\n2. summing the scores on each item; and \n3. subtracting the sum score from 50 (the max possible score). This will make higher scores reflect better perceived daytime functioning.  \n\nThe data is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/sleepdtf.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/sleepdtf.csv){target=\"_blank\"}. \n  \n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-sleepitems\n#| echo: false\n#| tbl-cap: Daytime Functioning Questionnaire\ntibble(\n  Item = paste0(\"Item_\",1:10),\n  Statement = c(\"I often felt an inability to concentrate\",\"I frequently forgot things\",\"I found thinking clearly required a lot of effort\",\"I often felt happy\",\"I had lots of energy\",\"I worked efficiently\",\"I often felt irritable\" ,\"I often felt stressed\",\"I often felt sleepy\", \"I often felt fatigued\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nLoad the required libraries (probably just __tidyverse__ for now), and read in the data.  \nCalculate the overall daytime functioning score, following the criteria outlined above, and make this a new column in your dataset.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints  \nTo reverse items 4, 5 and 6, we we need to make all the scores of 1 become 5, scores of 2 become 4, and so on... What number satisfies all of these equations: `? - 5 = 1`, `? - 4 = 2`, `? - 3 = 3`?  \n  \nTo quickly sum across rows, you might find the `rowSums()` function useful (you don't have to use it though)  \nIf my items were in columns between 4 to 15:  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\ndataframe$sumscore = rowSums(dataframe[, 4:15])\n```\n\n:::\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(label=\"Solution Part 1 - Reversing Items\", slabel=FALSE,show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r message=FALSE}\nsleepdtf <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/sleepdtf.csv\")\nsummary(sleepdtf)\n```\n\nTo reverse the items, we can simply do 6 minus the score: \n```{r}\nsleepdtf <- \n  sleepdtf |> mutate(\n    item_4=6-item_4,\n    item_5=6-item_5,\n    item_6=6-item_6\n  ) \n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"Solution Part 2 - Creating a scale score\", slabel=FALSE,show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nNow we can use `rowSums()`, and subtract the sum scores from from 50 (the max score):  \n```{r}\nsleepdtf$dtf = 50-rowSums(sleepdtf[, 2:11])\n```\n\nAn alternative way to do this would be: \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nsleepdtf |> \n  mutate(\n    dtf = 50 - (item_1 + item_2 + item_3 + item_4 + item_5 + item_6 + item_7 + item_8 + item_9 + item_10)\n  )\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nCalculate the correlation between the total sleep time (`TST`) and the overall daytime functioning score calculated in the previous question.  \nConduct a test to establish the probability of observing a correlation this strong in a sample of this size assuming the true correlation to be 0.  \n\nWrite a sentence or two summarising the results. \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints  \nYou can do this all with one function, see [5A #correlation-test](05a_covcor.html#correlation-tests){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\ncor.test(sleepdtf$TST, sleepdtf$dtf)\n```\n\n:::int\nThere was a strong positive correlation between total sleep time and self-reported daytime functioning score ($r$ = `r cor(sleepdtf$TST, sleepdtf$dtf) |> round(2)`, $t(48)$ = `r cor.test(sleepdtf$TST, sleepdtf$dtf)$statistic |> round(2)`, $p < .001$) in the current sample.

A total of `r nrow(simd_comp)` geographical areas were included in the analysis, with a mean school attendance of `r round(mean(simd_comp$attendance),2)` (SD = `r round(sd(simd_comp$attendance),2)`) and a mean school attainment score of `r round(mean(simd_comp$attainment),2)` (SD = `r round(sd(simd_comp$attainment),2)`).  \nThere was a strong positive correlation between a geographical area's level of school attendance and its school attainment ($r$ = `r round(res$estimate,2)`, $t(`r res$parameter`)$ = `r round(res$statistic,2)`, $p `r format.pval(res$p.value,eps = .001)`$).

They were interested in whether younger monkeys tend to be more inquisitive about new things than older monkeys do. They sampled `r nrow(monkeyexp)` monkeys ranging from `r min(monkeyexp$age)` to `r max(monkeyexp$age)` years old. Each monkey was given a novel object, the researchers recorded the time (in minutes) that each monkey spent exploring the object. \n\nFor this week, we're going to be investigating the research question:  \n\n> Do older monkeys spend more/less time exploring novel objects?  \n\nThe data is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/monkeyexplorers.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/monkeyexplorers.csv){target=\"_blank\"} and contains the variables described in @tbl-monkeydicts\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-monkeydicts\n#| echo: false\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data dictionary for monkeyexplorers.csv\"\ntibble(\n  variable = names(monkeyexp),\n  description = c(\"Monkey Name\",\"Age of monkey in years\",\"Time (in minutes) spent exploring the object\")\n  # , \"Species\", \"Type of novel object given (soft / moving)\",\"Main colour of object (red / green / blue)\",\"Size of object in cm (length of largest dimension of the object)\")\n) |>\n  gt::gt()\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`  \nFor this week, we're going to be investigating the following research question:  \n\n> Do older monkeys spend more/less time exploring novel objects?  \n\nRead in the data to your R session, then visualise and describe the *marginal distributions* of those variables which are of interest to us. These are the distribution of each variable (time spent exploring, and monkey age) *without* reference to the values of the other variables.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\n- You could use, for example, `geom_density()` for a density plot or `geom_histogram()` for a histogram.\n- Look at the shape, center and spread of the distribution. Is it symmetric or skewed? Is it unimodal or bimodal? \n- Do you notice any extreme observations?\n\n:::\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nmonkeyexp <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/monkeyexplorers.csv\")\nhead(monkeyexp)\n```\n\n\nWe can plot the marginal distribution of these two continuous variables as density curves, and add a boxplot underneath to check for the presence of outliers. The `width` of the geom_boxplot() is always quite wide, so I want to make it narrower so that we can see it at the same time as the density plot. Deciding on the exact value for the width here is just trial and error:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-agetimeplot\n#| fig.cap: \"Density plot and boxplot of monkey's age and their time spent exploring novel objects\"\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n# the patchwork library allows us to combine plots together\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 1/300) +\n  labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", \n       y = \"Probability density\") +\n\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = exploration_time)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 1/175) +\n  labs(x = \"Time spent exploring a\\n novel object (in minutes)\", \n       y = \"Probability density\")\n\n```\n\nThe plots suggests that the distributions of monkeys' ages and the time they spend exploring novel objects are both unimodal. Most of the monkeys are between roughly 8 and 18 years old, and most of them spent between 7 and 12 minutes exploring the objects. The boxplots suggest an outlier in the distribution of exploration-times, with one monkeys spending more than $1.5 \\times IQR$ beyond the 3rd quartile.  \n\nTo further summarize a distribution, it is typical to compute and report numerical summary statistics such as the mean and standard deviation.  \n\nAs we have seen, in earlier weeks, one way to compute these values is to use the `summarise()/summarize()` function from the `tidyverse` library:\n\n```{r}\nmonkeyexp |> \n  summarize(\n    mean_age = mean(age), \n    sd_age = sd(age),\n    mean_exptime = mean(exploration_time),\n    sd_exptime = sd(exploration_time)\n    )\n```\n\n:::int\nThe marginal distribution of age is unimodal with a mean of `r round(mean(monkeyexp$age),1)` years, and a standard deviation of `r round(sd(monkeyexp$age),1)`.  \nThe marginal distribution of time-spent-exploring is unimodal with a mean\nof `r round(mean(monkeyexp$exploration_time),1)` years, and a standard deviation of `r round(sd(monkeyexp$exploration_time),1)`.   \n:::\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`  \nAfter we've looked at the marginal distributions of the variables of interest in the analysis, we typically move on to examining *relationships* between the variables.  \n  \nVisualise and describe the relationship between age and exploration-time among the monkeys in the sample.  \n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\nThink about:  \n\n- *Direction* of association\n- *Form* of association (can it be summarised well with a straight line?)  \n- *Strength* of association (how closely do points fall to a recognizable pattern such as a line?)\n- *Unusual observations* that do not fit the pattern of the rest of the observations and which are worth examining in more detail.  \n:::\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\nBecause we are investigating how time-spent-exploring varies with monkeys' ages, the exploration-time here is the dependent variable (on the y-axis), and age is the independent variable (on the x-axis).\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-monkeyage-scatterplot\n#| fig.cap: \"The relationship between monkeys' age and time-spent-exploring.\"\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = age, y = exploration_time)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", \n       y = \"Time spent exploring a\\n novel object (in minutes)\")\n```\n\nThere appears to be a moderate negative linear relationship between age and exploration time in these monkeys. Older monkeys appear to spend less time, on average, exploring a novel object. The scatterplot does highlight that there is one one young monkey who is behaving a bit weirdly, and spent quite a long time exploring the object!  \n\nTo comment numerically on the strength of the linear association we might compute the correlation coefficient that we were introduced to in [5A: Covariance & Correlation](05a_covcor.html)\n```{r}\nmonkeyexp |>\n  select(age, exploration_time) |>\n  cor()\n```\n\nthat is, $r_{\\text{age, exploration-time}} = `r round(cor(monkeyexp[,c(\"age\",\"exploration_time\")])[1,2],2)`$\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nUsing the `lm()` function, fit a linear model to the sample data, in which time that monkeys spend exploring novel objects is explained by age.

Can you figure out if there are any unusual monkeys in our dataset? Can you re-fit the model without that monkey? When you do so, do your conclusions change?  \n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r echo=2}\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(model1)\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n```\n\nFrom these plots, we can see that the 57th observation is looking a bit influential. It is the one datapoint that is looking weird in all of the plots.    \nLet's look at them:  \n```{r}\nmonkeyexp[57, ]\n```\n\nThis is a young monkey (5 years old) called \"Lil Fizz\", who seems to have spent quite a long time exploring the toy. It's important to remember that this monkey is a valuable datapoint, despite being a bit different from the general pattern.  \n\nHowever, it would be nice to know how much Lil Fizz is affecting our conclusions, so let's re-fit the model on everybody except that one monkey \n\n```{r}\nmodel1a <- lm(exploration_time ~ age, data = monkeyexp[-57, ])\nsummary(model1a)\n```\n\nOur conclusions haven't changed - we still have a significant association.  \n\nWhat we have just done is called a \"sensitivity analysis\" - we've asked if our analyses are sensitive to a specific decision we could make (whether or not we include/exclude this monkey).  \n\n```{r}\n#| fig-height: 3.5\n#| code-fold: true\nggplot(monkeyexp, aes(x=age,y=exploration_time))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, fullrange=TRUE)+\n  ylim(0,34) + \n  labs(title=\"With monkey 57\") +\n\nggplot(monkeyexp[-57,], aes(x=age,y=exploration_time))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, fullrange=TRUE)+\n  ylim(0,34) + \n  labs(title=\"Without monkey 57\")\n```\n\nWe now have a decision to make. Do we continue with the monkey removed, or do we keep them in? There's not really a right answer here, but it's worth noting a practical issue - our assumption plots look considerably better for our model without this monkey.  \n\nWhatever we do, when writing up the analysis we need to mention clearly _if_ and _why_ we exclude any observations, and _how_ that decision has/hasn't influenced our conclusions. \n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Monkey Exploration in Adulthood\n\nLet's suppose instead of having measured monkeys' ages in years, researchers simply recorded whether each monkey was an adult or a juvenile (species like Capuchins and Rhesus Macaques reach adulthood at about 8 years old).  \nThe code below creates a this new variable for us:  \n```{r}\nmonkeyexp <- monkeyexp |> \n  mutate(\n    isAdult = ifelse(age >= 8, \"yes\",\"no\")\n  )\n```\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\n\nFit the following model, and interpret the coefficients.  \n\n$$\n\\text{ExplorationTime} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot \\text{isAdult} + \\varepsilon\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\nFor help interpreting the coefficients, see [5B #binary-predictors](05b_slr.html#binary-predictors){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\nmodel2 <- lm(exploration_time ~ 1 + isAdult, data = monkeyexp)\nsummary(model2)\n```\n- `(Intercept)` = the estimated exploration time of juvenile monkeys (`r round(coef(model2)[1],1)` minutes)\n- `isAdultyes` = the estimated change in exploration time from juvenile monkeys to adult monkeys (`r round(coef(model2)[2],1)` minutes)  \n\n```{r}\nggplot(monkeyexp, aes(x = isAdult, y = exploration_time)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nWe've actually already seen a way to analyse questions of this sort (\"is the average exploration-time different between juveniles and adults?\")  \n\nRun the following t-test, and consider the statistic, p value etc. How does it compare to the model in the previous question?  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nt.test(exploration_time ~ isAdult, data = monkeyexp, var.equal = TRUE)\n```\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\nt.test(exploration_time ~ isAdult, data = monkeyexp, var.equal = TRUE)\n```\n\nIt is identical! the $t$-statistics are the same, the p-values are the same, the degrees of freedom.

She recruited 50 healthy adults, and collected data on the Total Sleep Time (TST) over the course of a seven day period via sleep-tracking devices.  \nAt the end of the seven day period, participants completed a Daytime Functioning (DTF) questionnaire. This involved participants rating their agreement with ten statements (see @tbl-sleepitems). Agreement was measured on a scale from 1-5. An overall score of daytime functioning can be calculated by:  \n\n1. reversing the scores for items 4,5 and 6 (because those items reflect agreement with _positive_ statements, whereas the other ones are agreement with _negative_ statement);\n2. summing the scores on each item; and \n3. subtracting the sum score from 50 (the max possible score). This will make higher scores reflect better perceived daytime functioning.  \n\nThe data is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/sleepdtf.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/sleepdtf.csv){target=\"_blank\"}. \n  \n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-sleepitems\n#| echo: false\n#| tbl-cap: Daytime Functioning Questionnaire\ntibble(\n  Item = paste0(\"Item_\",1:10),\n  Statement = c(\"I often felt an inability to concentrate\",\"I frequently forgot things\",\"I found thinking clearly required a lot of effort\",\"I often felt happy\",\"I had lots of energy\",\"I worked efficiently\",\"I often felt irritable\" ,\"I often felt stressed\",\"I often felt sleepy\", \"I often felt fatigued\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nLoad the required libraries (probably just __tidyverse__ for now), and read in the data.  \nCalculate the overall daytime functioning score, following the criteria outlined above, and make this a new column in your dataset.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints  \nTo reverse items 4, 5 and 6, we we need to make all the scores of 1 become 5, scores of 2 become 4, and so on...

They were interested in whether younger monkeys tend to be more inquisitive about new things than older monkeys do. They sampled `r nrow(monkeyexp)` monkeys ranging from `r min(monkeyexp$age)` to `r max(monkeyexp$age)` years old. Each monkey was given a novel object, the researchers recorded the time (in minutes) that each monkey spent exploring the object. \n\nFor this week, we're going to be investigating the research question:  \n\n> Do older monkeys spend more/less time exploring novel objects?  \n\nThe data is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/monkeyexplorers.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/monkeyexplorers.csv){target=\"_blank\"} and contains the variables described in @tbl-monkeydicts\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-monkeydicts\n#| echo: false\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data dictionary for monkeyexplorers.csv\"\ntibble(\n  variable = names(monkeyexp),\n  description = c(\"Monkey Name\",\"Age of monkey in years\",\"Time (in minutes) spent exploring the object\")\n  # , \"Species\", \"Type of novel object given (soft / moving)\",\"Main colour of object (red / green / blue)\",\"Size of object in cm (length of largest dimension of the object)\")\n) |>\n  gt::gt()\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`  \nFor this week, we're going to be investigating the following research question:  \n\n> Do older monkeys spend more/less time exploring novel objects?  \n\nRead in the data to your R session, then visualise and describe the *marginal distributions* of those variables which are of interest to us. These are the distribution of each variable (time spent exploring, and monkey age) *without* reference to the values of the other variables.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\n- You could use, for example, `geom_density()` for a density plot or `geom_histogram()` for a histogram.\n- Look at the shape, center and spread of the distribution. Is it symmetric or skewed? Is it unimodal or bimodal? \n- Do you notice any extreme observations?\n\n:::\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nmonkeyexp <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/monkeyexplorers.csv\")\nhead(monkeyexp)\n```\n\n\nWe can plot the marginal distribution of these two continuous variables as density curves, and add a boxplot underneath to check for the presence of outliers. The `width` of the geom_boxplot() is always quite wide, so I want to make it narrower so that we can see it at the same time as the density plot. Deciding on the exact value for the width here is just trial and error:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-agetimeplot\n#| fig.cap: \"Density plot and boxplot of monkey's age and their time spent exploring novel objects\"\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n# the patchwork library allows us to combine plots together\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 1/300) +\n  labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", \n       y = \"Probability density\") +\n\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = exploration_time)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 1/175) +\n  labs(x = \"Time spent exploring a\\n novel object (in minutes)\", \n       y = \"Probability density\")\n\n```\n\nThe plots suggests that the distributions of monkeys' ages and the time they spend exploring novel objects are both unimodal. Most of the monkeys are between roughly 8 and 18 years old, and most of them spent between 7 and 12 minutes exploring the objects. The boxplots suggest an outlier in the distribution of exploration-times, with one monkeys spending more than $1.5 \\times IQR$ beyond the 3rd quartile.  \n\nTo further summarize a distribution, it is typical to compute and report numerical summary statistics such as the mean and standard deviation.  \n\nAs we have seen, in earlier weeks, one way to compute these values is to use the `summarise()/summarize()` function from the `tidyverse` library:\n\n```{r}\nmonkeyexp |> \n  summarize(\n    mean_age = mean(age), \n    sd_age = sd(age),\n    mean_exptime = mean(exploration_time),\n    sd_exptime = sd(exploration_time)\n    )\n```\n\n:::int\nThe marginal distribution of age is unimodal with a mean of `r round(mean(monkeyexp$age),1)` years, and a standard deviation of `r round(sd(monkeyexp$age),1)`.  \nThe marginal distribution of time-spent-exploring is unimodal with a mean\nof `r round(mean(monkeyexp$exploration_time),1)` years, and a standard deviation of `r round(sd(monkeyexp$exploration_time),1)`.   \n:::\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`  \nAfter we've looked at the marginal distributions of the variables of interest in the analysis, we typically move on to examining *relationships* between the variables.  \n  \nVisualise and describe the relationship between age and exploration-time among the monkeys in the sample.  \n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\nThink about:  \n\n- *Direction* of association\n- *Form* of association (can it be summarised well with a straight line?)  \n- *Strength* of association (how closely do points fall to a recognizable pattern such as a line?)\n- *Unusual observations* that do not fit the pattern of the rest of the observations and which are worth examining in more detail.  \n:::\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\nBecause we are investigating how time-spent-exploring varies with monkeys' ages, the exploration-time here is the dependent variable (on the y-axis), and age is the independent variable (on the x-axis).\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-monkeyage-scatterplot\n#| fig.cap: \"The relationship between monkeys' age and time-spent-exploring.\"\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = age, y = exploration_time)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", \n       y = \"Time spent exploring a\\n novel object (in minutes)\")\n```\n\nThere appears to be a moderate negative linear relationship between age and exploration time in these monkeys. Older monkeys appear to spend less time, on average, exploring a novel object. The scatterplot does highlight that there is one one young monkey who is behaving a bit weirdly, and spent quite a long time exploring the object!  \n\nTo comment numerically on the strength of the linear association we might compute the correlation coefficient that we were introduced to in [5A: Covariance & Correlation](05a_covcor.html)\n```{r}\nmonkeyexp |>\n  select(age, exploration_time) |>\n  cor()\n```\n\nthat is, $r_{\\text{age, exploration-time}} = `r round(cor(monkeyexp[,c(\"age\",\"exploration_time\")])[1,2],2)`$\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nUsing the `lm()` function, fit a linear model to the sample data, in which time that monkeys spend exploring novel objects is explained by age.

Can you figure out if there are any unusual monkeys in our dataset? Can you re-fit the model without that monkey? When you do so, do your conclusions change?  \n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r echo=2}\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(model1)\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n```\n\nFrom these plots, we can see that the 57th observation is looking a bit influential. It is the one datapoint that is looking weird in all of the plots.    \nLet's look at them:  \n```{r}\nmonkeyexp[57, ]\n```\n\nThis is a young monkey (5 years old) called \"Lil Fizz\", who seems to have spent quite a long time exploring the toy. It's important to remember that this monkey is a valuable datapoint, despite being a bit different from the general pattern.  \n\nHowever, it would be nice to know how much Lil Fizz is affecting our conclusions, so let's re-fit the model on everybody except that one monkey \n\n```{r}\nmodel1a <- lm(exploration_time ~ age, data = monkeyexp[-57, ])\nsummary(model1a)\n```\n\nOur conclusions haven't changed - we still have a significant association.  \n\nWhat we have just done is called a \"sensitivity analysis\" - we've asked if our analyses are sensitive to a specific decision we could make (whether or not we include/exclude this monkey).  \n\n```{r}\n#| fig-height: 3.5\n#| code-fold: true\nggplot(monkeyexp, aes(x=age,y=exploration_time))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, fullrange=TRUE)+\n  ylim(0,34) + \n  labs(title=\"With monkey 57\") +\n\nggplot(monkeyexp[-57,], aes(x=age,y=exploration_time))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, fullrange=TRUE)+\n  ylim(0,34) + \n  labs(title=\"Without monkey 57\")\n```\n\nWe now have a decision to make. Do we continue with the monkey removed, or do we keep them in? There's not really a right answer here, but it's worth noting a practical issue - our assumption plots look considerably better for our model without this monkey.  \n\nWhatever we do, when writing up the analysis we need to mention clearly _if_ and _why_ we exclude any observations, and _how_ that decision has/hasn't influenced our conclusions. \n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Monkey Exploration in Adulthood\n\nLet's suppose instead of having measured monkeys' ages in years, researchers simply recorded whether each monkey was an adult or a juvenile (species like Capuchins and Rhesus Macaques reach adulthood at about 8 years old).  \nThe code below creates a this new variable for us:  \n```{r}\nmonkeyexp <- monkeyexp |> \n  mutate(\n    isAdult = ifelse(age >= 8, \"yes\",\"no\")\n  )\n```\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\n\nFit the following model, and interpret the coefficients.  \n\n$$\n\\text{ExplorationTime} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot \\text{isAdult} + \\varepsilon\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\nFor help interpreting the coefficients, see [5B #binary-predictors](05b_slr.html#binary-predictors){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\nmodel2 <- lm(exploration_time ~ 1 + isAdult, data = monkeyexp)\nsummary(model2)\n```\n- `(Intercept)` = the estimated exploration time of juvenile monkeys (`r round(coef(model2)[1],1)` minutes)\n- `isAdultyes` = the estimated change in exploration time from juvenile monkeys to adult monkeys (`r round(coef(model2)[2],1)` minutes)  \n\n```{r}\nggplot(monkeyexp, aes(x = isAdult, y = exploration_time)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nWe've actually already seen a way to analyse questions of this sort (\"is the average exploration-time different between juveniles and adults?\")  \n\nRun the following t-test, and consider the statistic, p value etc. How does it compare to the model in the previous question?  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nt.test(exploration_time ~ isAdult, data = monkeyexp, var.equal = TRUE)\n```\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\nt.test(exploration_time ~ isAdult, data = monkeyexp, var.equal = TRUE)\n```\n\nIt is identical! the $t$-statistics are the same, the p-values are the same, the degrees of freedom.

a screenshot/put it in a .Rmd and knit/whatever gets the picture uploaded!)   \n\nAll plots submitted by end-of-day on 25th October will be rated by a number of non-USMR staff, and prizes made of chocolate will be awarded to the team with the prettiest plot and to the team with the ugliest plot. \n\n\n`r qend()`\n\n\n\n<div class=\"tocify-extend-page\" data-unique=\"tocify-extend-page\"
