They have conducted a small study of `r nrow(couchto5k)` people in 2 cities (Edinburgh and Glasgow), all of whom started the Couch to 5k programme, across the course of a year.  \n\nThe researchers' interests are two-fold: They are interested in the effects of taking the programme on psychological wellbeing, and also in the psychological factors that make people continue on the programme. \n\n__Methods__  \n\nAt Week 0, all participants completed a questionnaire measuring the psychometric factors of accountability and self-motivation.  \nUpon either completing the programme (Week 9) or dropping out (< Week 9), participants completed a questionnaire which included a measure of their self-reported happiness, and a \"health\" measure derived from a number of physiological tests. Researchers also recorded the season in which participants started the programme, as evidence from previous research suggests that the probability of completing the couch to 5k programme varies substantially across the year. \n\nYou can download the dataset from [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/couchto5k.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/couchto5k.csv). Details of the variables can be found in the table below.    \n  \n_Please note that Couch to 5k is a real programme, but the data you will be analysing comes from our febrile minds._  \n  \n---\n\n__Data Dictionary:__\n\nColumn    | Content\n----------|-------------\n`pptID`   | random ID code for participant\n`age`     | age in years\n`accountability` | psychometric measure of accountability (or 'responsibility') (Sum of 5 questions, each scored 1-7). \n`selfmot` | psychometric measure of self-motivation (Sum of 5 questions, each scored 1-7)\n`health`  | multi-test health measure (0-100)\n`happiness` | simple happiness scale (0-100)\n`season`  | season of the year participants were interviewed in\n`city`    | city participant was recruited in\n`week_stopped` | week of programme participant stopped in (week 9 = completed the programme)\n\n\n:::\n\n<br>  \n\n## Clean and describe\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nHave a look at the data.

Remember to detail the decisions you have made.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\n- to clean data, go through each variable in turn. If numeric, what is the min and max? If categorical, what are the possible levels?  \n- to describe data, you might want to use tables and plots, or you might find describing in text can work too.  \n- There's no right way to deal with missing values. \n  - one option is to cross-tabulate the _reasons for_ missingness, and then remove them from the dataset at this point. This means all your analyses are conducted on the same set of \"complete cases\". This can be the neat and tidy option, but if some variables have lots of missingness, you might end up needlessly limiting some of your analyses in terms of statistical power. \n  - another option is to leave all missing values in the dataset and let them be dealt with by each of your model(s) and test(s). The downside of this is that different tests end up being performed on different subsets of data, making it harder to describe (it also means you need to be very careful with model comparisons)\n- There's no right way to deal with outliers.  \n  - Some fields of research will identify at the outset any observations that are outlying by looking at each variable individually. These they will then remove, or scale back ([6A #outliers](06_wt.html#outliers){target=\"_blank\"}) prior to any analysis. This should really only be done if you are sure that these observations are outlying because of either a) measurement error or b) not belonging to the target population of interest. If the outlyingness could well simply be natural variation in the variable, keep it in. You can always then examine its influence on subsequent analyses!  \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(\"Explore\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\ncouchto5k <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/couchto5k.csv\")\n```\n\n\nGoing through each variable:  \n\n- `age` is an integer variable, shouldn't have negative values **by definition of variable**.

Could this be interpreted as someone doing the programme for an extra 5 weeks beyond the 9? In which case could we turn that 12 into a 9? It's just a possible that it's a typo, and it's supposed to be a 1.

Spring and summer were the most common seasons for attempting the programme (`r round(prop.table(table(couchto5k$season))*100)[1]`% and `r round(prop.table(table(couchto5k$season))*100)[2]`% of participants respectively), with `r round(prop.table(table(couchto5k$season))*100)[3]`% undertaking it in autumn and only `r round(prop.table(table(couchto5k$season))*100)[4]`% in winter. \n\n`r solend()`\n\n<br>  \n\n## City differences\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\n\nThe researchers conducting the study want to first find out a little more about differences between the Edinburgh and Glasgow study sites. Specifically, they would like to investigate whether dropping out of the programme early (prior to week 5), late (week 5 onwards) or not at all (completed all 9 weeks), is different between Edinburgh and Glasgow participants. They would also like to know if the average age of participants is different between the cities.  \n\nPerform any appropriate analyses and write up your methods and results, providing plots and tables where useful.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\n- There are two questions here: city differences in dropout, and city differences in age. These are nice and simple questions about the relationships between only two variables.  \n- You might need to make a new variable for \"early/late/no dropout\".  \n- The first 5 weeks of the course focused on some of the more fundamental tests of relationships between two variables. Some of these might be useful here!  \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(\"Testing City Dropouts\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nThe `dropout ~ city` question is asking us to categorise when participants stop the programme into \"early\", \"late\", or \"not at all\". So the question is `categorical ~ categorical`. Sounds like a $\\chi^2$ test to me!  \n\n```{r}\ncouchto5k <- \n  couchto5k |>\n    mutate(\n      dropout = ifelse(week_stopped < 5, \"early\",\n                      ifelse(week_stopped <9, \"late\", \"not at all\"))\n    )\n```\n\nlet's check that the above `ifelse` statement worked as we wanted:  \n```{r}\ntable(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$week_stopped)\n```\n\nand let's look at the differences between the cities, and also perform a $\\chi^2$ test. \nWe're going to simulate the p-value here, because some of our expected cell counts are going to be $<5$ (see e.g. [Week 4 Exercises #favourite-colours](04_ex.html#childrens-favourite-colours){target=\"_blank\"})  \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\ntable(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city)\nchisq.test(table(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city), simulate.p.value = TRUE)\n```\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntable(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city)\nres_dropout <- chisq.test(table(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city), simulate.p.value = TRUE)\nres_dropout\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Testing City Differences in Age\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe `age ~ city` question, on the other hand, is asking whether a continuous variable is different between two groups (Edinburgh and Glasgow). We can do this with a $t$-test!   \n\nLet's first assess the extent to which the ages of two groups of participants (Edinburgh folk and Glasgow folk) have similar variances (an assumption of the standard t-test), as well as the extent to which they are normally distributed: \n\n```{r echo=c(-1)}\n#| fig-height: 4\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\n\nhist(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Edinburgh\"], \n     main = \"Edinburgh\", xlab = \"Age\")\nhist(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Glasgow\"], \n     main = \"Glasgow\", xlab = \"Age\")\n\nqqnorm(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Edinburgh\"], main = \"Edinburgh\")\nqqline(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Edinburgh\"])\n\nqqnorm(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Glasgow\"], main = \"Glasgow\")\nqqline(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Glasgow\"])\n```\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n```\n\n\nThese look almost okay to me. Not great, but not completely awful. We should bear in mind that we have >30 participants in each group, which means we can be a little more relaxed about requiring very close to normal data.  \n\nThe test of equal variances suggests we have no reason to reject the hypothesis that the two groups have equal variances: \n```{r}\nvar.test(age ~ city, data = couchto5k)\n```\n\nSo we can carry on with our t-test of the difference in means^[If we had reason to believe the variances are not equal, we can look at doing Welch's t-test]:  \n```{r}\nt.test(age ~ city, data = couchto5k, var.equal = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Writing up\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nres_age <- t.test(age ~ city, data = couchto5k, var.equal = TRUE)\n```\n\n\nA $\\chi^2$ test of independence indicated that rate of attrition (early-/late-/no- dropout) did not significantly differ between Edinburgh and Glasgow ($\\chi^2$(n=`r sum(res_dropout$observed)`) = `r round(res_dropout$statistic,3)`, Monte Carlo simulated (B=2000) p = `r round(res_dropout$p.value,3)`). From both cities, approximately half of participants did not drop out of the programme, late drop-outs made up 13% of Glasgow participants and 9% of those from Edinburgh, with the remainder dropping out early (39% of Glasgow, 40% of Edinburgh).  \n\nThe mean age of participants was not significantly different between the two cities ($t( `r res_age[['parameter']]` )=`r round(res_age[['statistic']],2)`$, $p=`r round(res_age[['p.value']],2)`$), with a mean age in Edinburgh of `r round(res_age$estimate,1)[1]` and in Glasgow of `r round(res_age$estimate,1)[2]`.\n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<br>  \n\n## Happiness, Health, and a 5k Run  \n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nResearchers would like you to examine whether, beyond seasonal and age-related variation, happiness ratings are influenced by how far participants get through the couchto5k programme. Note that they are interested specifically in whether - and how - the effects of couchto5k progression are amplified by feeling healthy, such that getting further along in the programme might lead to greater increases in happiness when people are healthier.    \n\nPerform an appropriate analysis and write up your methods and results, providing plots and tables where useful.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\n- The use of the word \"beyond\" here should cue us to be thinking in terms of multiple regression. The question is asking about the relationship between happiness and couchto5k progression _after_ we account for participants' ages and the season in which they took the programme.  \n- We also have a clear suggestion of an interaction here, because it asks about an effect of one predictor on the outcome (programme progression on happiness) being \"amplified\" (i.e. _different_) by another predictor (health)\n- This feels a bit like two questions, but the latter really supersedes the first - if we have an interaction, then the question of \"what is the effect of progression on happiness?\" can only really be answered with \"it depends..\".      \n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Fitting model(s)\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nlet's standardise the health measure, because we probably don't want to look at things where people have health of 0, and i'm not sure that an increase of 1 is that meaningful..    \n```{r}\ncouchto5k <- couchto5k |>\n  mutate(\n    healthZ = (health-mean(health))/sd(health),\n  )\n```\nHere's our model:  \n```{r}\nhhmod <- lm(happiness ~ age + season + week_stopped * healthZ, couchto5k)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Check Assumptions\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n\nlet's take a look at assumptions\n```{r echo=c(2)}\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(hhmod)\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n```\nso this looks a little weird - we've got some sharp 'edges' to our cloud of data in the residual vs fitted plot.  \nWhat I think this is reflecting is that we are being limited by the bounds of the happiness measure (i.e. people are using the full scale of 0 up to 100). Consider how this might influence the residuals. As predicted values get closer to the edges of the scale, the residuals will get smaller. This might not be too much of a problem, but may well be worth discussing. \n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Testing\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nLet's conduct an F-test of the interaction:  \n```{r}\nanova(hhmod)\n```\n\n- the final row tells us that the interaction weekstopped*health explains significantly more variance than we would expect by chance\n\n\n- the coefficients can tell us effect sizes, directions etc.  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nsummary(hhmod)\n```\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n.pp(summary(hhmod), l=list(10:19))\n```\n\ngetting further along the couchto5k programme is associated with being more happy, the more healthy you feel. \n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Visualising\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n- and plots are going to be a *very* useful way to understand and to present.  \n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\nplotdat <- expand_grid(\n  age = mean(couchto5k$age),\n  season = \"spring\",\n  week_stopped=1:9,\n  healthZ = c(-1, 0, 1)\n)\n\nbroom::augment(hhmod, newdata = plotdat, interval=\"confidence\") |>\n  mutate(\n    health = factor(healthZ, levels=c(\"-1\",\"0\",\"1\"),\n                    labels=c(\"Poor health (-1 SD)\", \n                             \"Average health\",\n                             \"Good health (+1 SD)\")\n                    )\n  ) |> ggplot(aes(x=week_stopped,y=.fitted, col=health,fill=health))+\n  geom_line(aes(lty=health)) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=.lower,ymax=.upper), alpha=.2) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(option=\"C\")+\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option=\"C\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:9)+\n  labs(y=\"Happiness (0-100)\",x=\"- Week Stopped -\") +\n  guides(col=\"none\",fill=\"none\")\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Standardised Coefs?\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n- we can also, if we want, get out some standardised coefficients - i.e. some coefficients in terms of standard deviations (for those predictors where SD is applicable).

The regression model appeared to meet all assumptions, with residuals displaying a constant mean at approximately zero, although the boundaries of the happiness scale induced a smaller residual variance at the tail ends of the fitted values (see Appendix X). This is corroborated by 30% of participants reporting happiness in either the bottom or top 10th of the scale. \n\nAnalysis of variance indicated that after accounting for season and age, there was a significant interaction between participants' self-reported health at the end of the programme and the week at which they stopped ($F(`r res1[5,1]`,`r res1[6,1]`)=`r res1[5,4]`$,  $p `r res1[5,5]`$).

Sounds like a binary outcome!  \n- Recall (from study description above) that completing the programme has previously been found to vary substantially across the year. _We may well therefore want to account for this in our model!_  \n- What variables do we have that measure \"psychological factors\" that might influence dropping out? (pay attention to _when_ each variable is measured!)  \n- How might we visualise the results?   \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(\"Outcome Variable\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWe need to make a binary outcome out of the `week_stopped` variable. \n```{r}\ncouchto5k <- couchto5k |>\n  mutate(\n    completed = ifelse(week_stopped == 9, 1, 0)\n  )\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Fitting model(s)\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nSo what is going into our model? We know that we're interested in the 'psychological factors' (i.e. the variables `accountability` and `selfmot`), so at the very least we will have `dropout ~ ?? + accountability + selfmot`.  \n\nBut what about controlling for other variables?  \nPer the study description, many of these were measured after participants stopped programme.  \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n  variable = names(couchto5k)[-11],\n  when = c(NA, \"unclear when measured, but assume it is consistent at both points\", \"measured at start\",\"measured at start\", rep(\"measured at end\", 2), \"measured at start\", \"unclear when measured, but assume it is consistent at both points\", rep(\"measured at end\", 3))\n) |> pander::pander()\n```\n\nIt doesn't really make sense for us to think about your happiness _after_ the programme influencing whether or not you complete it (this is not to say that it will not be associated).  \n\nage, season and city are all things that *might* influence completion, or might influence predictors of interest like accountability or self-motivation. We know specifically that season has previously been found to influence completion, so it would be good to at least include that. I can think up some argument that older people are more motivated/hold themselves more accountable, and so I might want to control for age to ensure I am looking at the independent effects of these psychological features separate from any age effects.  \n\nIt's probably worth scaling the `accountability` and `selfmot` variables. They are both the sum of 7 questions, each scored 1-5, so it's slightly unclear what a \"1 unit increase\" really means. It's answering.  \n```{r}\ncouchto5k <-\n  couchto5k |> \n  mutate(\n    accountabilityZ = scale(accountability)[,1],\n    selfmotZ = scale(selfmot)[,1]\n  )\n```\n\nAnd here's a model!  \n```{r}\ncompmod <- glm(completed ~ season + age + city + accountabilityZ + selfmotZ, \n               data = couchto5k, family=binomial)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Testing the influence of 'psychological factors'\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nTo examine whether psychological factors (collectively) are associated with more/less probability of completing the couchto5k programme, we can compare our model:  \n```{r}\ncompmod <- glm(completed ~ season + age + city + accountabilityZ + selfmotZ, \n               data = couchto5k, family=binomial)\n```\n\nWith a restricted model that doesn't include them:\n```{r}\ncompmod0 <- glm(completed ~ season + age + city, data = couchto5k, family=binomial)\n\n```\n\n```{r}\nanova(compmod0, compmod, test=\"Chisq\")\n```\n\nbeyond participants' age, location and which season programme is undertaken in, psychological factors of accountability and self motivation _do_ appear to improve model fit  \n\nFrom our coefficients, we can see that this is likely being driven by an association between self-motivation and the probability of completing the couchto5k programme:  \n\n```{r}\nsummary(compmod)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Visualising\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nIt's always worth visualising the two focal predictors in terms of predicted probability of completion.  \n\nNote that because so few people took part in autumn and winter, this introduces a lot of uncertainty if we try and get at the effect holding `season` at its proportion, so we might be better off just providing the plot for Spring, as that is the most frequent season that people start the programme.  \n```{r}\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nlibrary(effects)\np1 <- effect(c(\"selfmotZ\",\"season\"), compmod, xlevels=20) |>\n  as.data.frame() |>\n  filter(season==\"spring\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=selfmotZ,y=fit))+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper),alpha=.2) +\n  labs(title=\"Predicted probability of\\ncouch-to-5k completion\",x=\"Self Motivation (Z-scored)\",y=\"P(Completed)\")\n\np2 <- effect(c(\"accountabilityZ\",\"season\"), compmod, xlevels=20) |>\n  as.data.frame() |>\n  filter(season==\"spring\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=accountabilityZ,y=fit))+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper),alpha=.2) +\n  labs(title=\"Predicted probability of\\ncouch-to-5k completion\",x=\"Accountability (Z-scored)\",y=\"P(Completed)\")\n\np1 + p2\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r solbegin(\"Writing up\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nres3 = anova(compmod0, compmod, test=\"Chisq\")\nres4 = exp(car::Confint(compmod))\nres4 = apply(res4,2, function(x) round(x,2))\n```\n\nCouch-to-5k completion (completed vs dropped out) was modelled using logistic regression, with the location (Glasgow, Edinburgh) and season in which participants undertake the programme as predictors, along with participants age, and their scores on two psychometric measures of accountability and self-motivation that were administered prior to participants starting the programme. A likelihood ratio test indicated that the inclusion of these two measures (accountability and self-motivation) collectively improves model fit over and above age, location and season ($\\chi^2(`r res3[2,3]`) = `r round(res3[2,4],2)`, \\, p = `r round(res3[2,5],3)`$). All deviance residuals for the full model were less than 3 in magnitude. \n\nIn keeping with previous research, completion of the programme was found to differ between seasons, with participants undertaking the programme in both summer and autumn being associated with increased odds of programme completion ($OR: `r res4[2,1]`$, $95\\% CI [`r paste0(res4[2,2:3],collapse=\", \")`]$ and $`r res4[3,1]`$ $[`r paste0(res4[3,2:3],collapse=\", \")`]$ respectively). Age and city were not found to significantly predict completion.  \n\nWhile completing the programme was not significantly associated with scores on the accountability measure, a relationship was found between self motivation and programme completion; a 1 standard deviation increase in self-motivation was associated with doubling the odds of finishing the entire 9-weeks ($OR: `r res4[8,1]`\\, [`r paste0(res4[8,2:3],collapse=\", \")`]$). The model-predicted probabilities of programme completion across values of the two psychometric measures are visualised in @fig-couchglm. Full table of results can be found in @tbl-couchglmcoef  \n\nThe present study indicated that the psychometric factors of accountability and self motivation, taken together, were useful in predicting the completion (vs drop out) of the couch-to-5k programme. Specifically, a strong association was found between self-motivation and programme completion, with more motivated participants have a higher probability of finishing the full 9 weeks.  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-couchglm\n#| fig-cap: \"Model estimated probability of completing the couch-to-5k programme across measures of accountability and self-motivation (both Z-scored), estimated for starting the programme in spring, and holding other predictors at their average/proportions\"\n#| echo: false\n\np1 + p2 & theme_bw(base_size=12)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-couchglmcoef\n#| tbl-cap: \"Couch-to-5k completion modeled using logistic regression.

They have conducted a small study of `r nrow(couchto5k)` people in 2 cities (Edinburgh and Glasgow), all of whom started the Couch to 5k programme, across the course of a year.  \n\nThe researchers' interests are two-fold: They are interested in the effects of taking the programme on psychological wellbeing, and also in the psychological factors that make people continue on the programme. \n\n__Methods__  \n\nAt Week 0, all participants completed a questionnaire measuring the psychometric factors of accountability and self-motivation.  \nUpon either completing the programme (Week 9) or dropping out (< Week 9), participants completed a questionnaire which included a measure of their self-reported happiness, and a \"health\" measure derived from a number of physiological tests. Researchers also recorded the season in which participants started the programme, as evidence from previous research suggests that the probability of completing the couch to 5k programme varies substantially across the year. \n\nYou can download the dataset from [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/couchto5k.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/couchto5k.csv).

If categorical, what are the possible levels?  \n- to describe data, you might want to use tables and plots, or you might find describing in text can work too.  \n- There's no right way to deal with missing values. \n  - one option is to cross-tabulate the _reasons for_ missingness, and then remove them from the dataset at this point. This means all your analyses are conducted on the same set of \"complete cases\". This can be the neat and tidy option, but if some variables have lots of missingness, you might end up needlessly limiting some of your analyses in terms of statistical power. \n  - another option is to leave all missing values in the dataset and let them be dealt with by each of your model(s) and test(s). The downside of this is that different tests end up being performed on different subsets of data, making it harder to describe (it also means you need to be very careful with model comparisons)\n- There's no right way to deal with outliers.  \n  - Some fields of research will identify at the outset any observations that are outlying by looking at each variable individually. These they will then remove, or scale back ([6A #outliers](06_wt.html#outliers){target=\"_blank\"}) prior to any analysis. This should really only be done if you are sure that these observations are outlying because of either a) measurement error or b) not belonging to the target population of interest. If the outlyingness could well simply be natural variation in the variable, keep it in.

These are nice and simple questions about the relationships between only two variables.  \n- You might need to make a new variable for \"early/late/no dropout\".  \n- The first 5 weeks of the course focused on some of the more fundamental tests of relationships between two variables. Some of these might be useful here!  \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(\"Testing City Dropouts\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nThe `dropout ~ city` question is asking us to categorise when participants stop the programme into \"early\", \"late\", or \"not at all\". So the question is `categorical ~ categorical`. Sounds like a $\\chi^2$ test to me!  \n\n```{r}\ncouchto5k <- \n  couchto5k |>\n    mutate(\n      dropout = ifelse(week_stopped < 5, \"early\",\n                      ifelse(week_stopped <9, \"late\", \"not at all\"))\n    )\n```\n\nlet's check that the above `ifelse` statement worked as we wanted:  \n```{r}\ntable(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$week_stopped)\n```\n\nand let's look at the differences between the cities, and also perform a $\\chi^2$ test. \nWe're going to simulate the p-value here, because some of our expected cell counts are going to be $<5$ (see e.g. [Week 4 Exercises #favourite-colours](04_ex.html#childrens-favourite-colours){target=\"_blank\"})  \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\ntable(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city)\nchisq.test(table(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city), simulate.p.value = TRUE)\n```\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntable(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city)\nres_dropout <- chisq.test(table(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city), simulate.p.value = TRUE)\nres_dropout\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Testing City Differences in Age\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe `age ~ city` question, on the other hand, is asking whether a continuous variable is different between two groups (Edinburgh and Glasgow). We can do this with a $t$-test!   \n\nLet's first assess the extent to which the ages of two groups of participants (Edinburgh folk and Glasgow folk) have similar variances (an assumption of the standard t-test), as well as the extent to which they are normally distributed: \n\n```{r echo=c(-1)}\n#| fig-height: 4\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\n\nhist(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Edinburgh\"], \n     main = \"Edinburgh\", xlab = \"Age\")\nhist(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Glasgow\"], \n     main = \"Glasgow\", xlab = \"Age\")\n\nqqnorm(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Edinburgh\"], main = \"Edinburgh\")\nqqline(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Edinburgh\"])\n\nqqnorm(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Glasgow\"], main = \"Glasgow\")\nqqline(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Glasgow\"])\n```\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n```\n\n\nThese look almost okay to me. Not great, but not completely awful. We should bear in mind that we have >30 participants in each group, which means we can be a little more relaxed about requiring very close to normal data.  \n\nThe test of equal variances suggests we have no reason to reject the hypothesis that the two groups have equal variances: \n```{r}\nvar.test(age ~ city, data = couchto5k)\n```\n\nSo we can carry on with our t-test of the difference in means^[If we had reason to believe the variances are not equal, we can look at doing Welch's t-test]:  \n```{r}\nt.test(age ~ city, data = couchto5k, var.equal = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Writing up\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nres_age <- t.test(age ~ city, data = couchto5k, var.equal = TRUE)\n```\n\n\nA $\\chi^2$ test of independence indicated that rate of attrition (early-/late-/no- dropout) did not significantly differ between Edinburgh and Glasgow ($\\chi^2$(n=`r sum(res_dropout$observed)`) = `r round(res_dropout$statistic,3)`, Monte Carlo simulated (B=2000) p = `r round(res_dropout$p.value,3)`). From both cities, approximately half of participants did not drop out of the programme, late drop-outs made up 13% of Glasgow participants and 9% of those from Edinburgh, with the remainder dropping out early (39% of Glasgow, 40% of Edinburgh).  \n\nThe mean age of participants was not significantly different between the two cities ($t( `r res_age[['parameter']]` )=`r round(res_age[['statistic']],2)`$, $p=`r round(res_age[['p.value']],2)`$), with a mean age in Edinburgh of `r round(res_age$estimate,1)[1]` and in Glasgow of `r round(res_age$estimate,1)[2]`.\n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<br>  \n\n## Happiness, Health, and a 5k Run  \n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nResearchers would like you to examine whether, beyond seasonal and age-related variation, happiness ratings are influenced by how far participants get through the couchto5k programme. Note that they are interested specifically in whether - and how - the effects of couchto5k progression are amplified by feeling healthy, such that getting further along in the programme might lead to greater increases in happiness when people are healthier.    \n\nPerform an appropriate analysis and write up your methods and results, providing plots and tables where useful.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\n- The use of the word \"beyond\" here should cue us to be thinking in terms of multiple regression. The question is asking about the relationship between happiness and couchto5k progression _after_ we account for participants' ages and the season in which they took the programme.  \n- We also have a clear suggestion of an interaction here, because it asks about an effect of one predictor on the outcome (programme progression on happiness) being \"amplified\" (i.e. _different_) by another predictor (health)\n- This feels a bit like two questions, but the latter really supersedes the first - if we have an interaction, then the question of \"what is the effect of progression on happiness?\" can only really be answered with \"it depends..\".      \n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Fitting model(s)\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nlet's standardise the health measure, because we probably don't want to look at things where people have health of 0, and i'm not sure that an increase of 1 is that meaningful..    \n```{r}\ncouchto5k <- couchto5k |>\n  mutate(\n    healthZ = (health-mean(health))/sd(health),\n  )\n```\nHere's our model:  \n```{r}\nhhmod <- lm(happiness ~ age + season + week_stopped * healthZ, couchto5k)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Check Assumptions\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n\nlet's take a look at assumptions\n```{r echo=c(2)}\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(hhmod)\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n```\nso this looks a little weird - we've got some sharp 'edges' to our cloud of data in the residual vs fitted plot.  \nWhat I think this is reflecting is that we are being limited by the bounds of the happiness measure (i.e. people are using the full scale of 0 up to 100). Consider how this might influence the residuals. As predicted values get closer to the edges of the scale, the residuals will get smaller.

The regression model appeared to meet all assumptions, with residuals displaying a constant mean at approximately zero, although the boundaries of the happiness scale induced a smaller residual variance at the tail ends of the fitted values (see Appendix X). This is corroborated by 30% of participants reporting happiness in either the bottom or top 10th of the scale. \n\nAnalysis of variance indicated that after accounting for season and age, there was a significant interaction between participants' self-reported health at the end of the programme and the week at which they stopped ($F(`r res1[5,1]`,`r res1[6,1]`)=`r res1[5,4]`$,  $p `r res1[5,5]`$). The full model explained approximately `r round(summary(hhmod)$adj.r.squared*100)`% (adjusted $R^2$) of the variance in happiness scores.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: tbl-couchanova\n#| tbl-cap: \"Analysis of variance in happiness scores\" \nrownames(res1) <- c(\"Age\",\"Season\",\"Week Stopped\",\"Health\",\"Week Stopped : Health\", \"Residual\")\nres1[,2:3] <- apply(res1[,2:3], 2, round)\ncolnames(res1) <- c(\"df\",\"Sum Sq\",\"Mean Sq\",\"F\",\"p\")\nres1$p[c(3,5)] <- paste0(\"**\",res1$p[c(3,5)],\"**\")\nres1[6,4:5]<-\"\"\npander::pander(res1)\n```\n\nFor those of average health, there was no statistically reliable change in happiness associated with additional weeks of the couch-to-5k programme ($b = `r res2[6,2]`$, $\\beta = `r res2[6,3]`$, $t(`r hhmod[['df.residual']]`) = \\, `r res2[6,5]`$, $p = `r res2[6,6]`$).\n\nHowever this effect was moderated by health such that the weekly change in happiness was more positive for healthier, and more negative for less healthy, people. For each 1SD (`r round(sd(couchto5k$health))` raw points) change in health from the average, happiness ratings changed by an additional `r res2[8,2]` points every week ($b = `r res2[8,2]`$, $\\beta = `r res2[8,3]`$, $t(`r hhmod[['df.residual']]`) = \\, `r res2[8,5]`$, $p `r res2[8,6]`$). \n@fig-couchint shows the shape of this interaction, and a full regression table can be found in @tbl-couchinttab.  \n\nHappiness following the couch-to-5k programme was found to be related to how far through the programme participants got, and this relationship depended on participant health, with the happiness of healthier participants increasing more for every week longer through the programme they lasted than it did for participants of average health. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-couchint\n#| fig-cap: \"Interaction between health and duration completed of couch-to-5k on happiness, estimated for the average age and commencing the programme in Spring\"\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\n#| echo: false\nplotdat <- expand_grid(\n  age = mean(couchto5k$age),\n  season = \"spring\",\n  week_stopped=1:9,\n  healthZ = c(-1, 0, 1)\n)\n\nbroom::augment(hhmod, newdata = plotdat, interval=\"confidence\") |>\n  mutate(\n    health = factor(healthZ, levels=c(\"-1\",\"0\",\"1\"),\n                    labels=c(\"Poor health (-1 SD)\", \n                             \"Average health\",\n                             \"Good health (+1 SD)\")\n                    )\n  ) |> ggplot(aes(x=week_stopped,y=.fitted, col=health,fill=health))+\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=.lower,ymax=.upper), alpha=.2) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(option=\"C\")+\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option=\"C\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:9)+\n  facet_wrap(~health) +\n  labs(y=\"Happiness (0-100)\",x=\"- Week Stopped -\") +\n  guides(col=\"none\",fill=\"none\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-couchinttab\n#| tbl-cap: \"Happiness ratings (0-100).

Sounds like a binary outcome!  \n- Recall (from study description above) that completing the programme has previously been found to vary substantially across the year. _We may well therefore want to account for this in our model!_  \n- What variables do we have that measure \"psychological factors\" that might influence dropping out? (pay attention to _when_ each variable is measured!)  \n- How might we visualise the results?   \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(\"Outcome Variable\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWe need to make a binary outcome out of the `week_stopped` variable. \n```{r}\ncouchto5k <- couchto5k |>\n  mutate(\n    completed = ifelse(week_stopped == 9, 1, 0)\n  )\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Fitting model(s)\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nSo what is going into our model? We know that we're interested in the 'psychological factors' (i.e. the variables `accountability` and `selfmot`), so at the very least we will have `dropout ~ ?? + accountability + selfmot`.  \n\nBut what about controlling for other variables?  \nPer the study description, many of these were measured after participants stopped programme.  \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n  variable = names(couchto5k)[-11],\n  when = c(NA, \"unclear when measured, but assume it is consistent at both points\", \"measured at start\",\"measured at start\", rep(\"measured at end\", 2), \"measured at start\", \"unclear when measured, but assume it is consistent at both points\", rep(\"measured at end\", 3))\n) |> pander::pander()\n```\n\nIt doesn't really make sense for us to think about your happiness _after_ the programme influencing whether or not you complete it (this is not to say that it will not be associated).  \n\nage, season and city are all things that *might* influence completion, or might influence predictors of interest like accountability or self-motivation. We know specifically that season has previously been found to influence completion, so it would be good to at least include that. I can think up some argument that older people are more motivated/hold themselves more accountable, and so I might want to control for age to ensure I am looking at the independent effects of these psychological features separate from any age effects.  \n\nIt's probably worth scaling the `accountability` and `selfmot` variables. They are both the sum of 7 questions, each scored 1-5, so it's slightly unclear what a \"1 unit increase\" really means. It's answering.  \n```{r}\ncouchto5k <-\n  couchto5k |> \n  mutate(\n    accountabilityZ = scale(accountability)[,1],\n    selfmotZ = scale(selfmot)[,1]\n  )\n```\n\nAnd here's a model!  \n```{r}\ncompmod <- glm(completed ~ season + age + city + accountabilityZ + selfmotZ, \n               data = couchto5k, family=binomial)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Testing the influence of 'psychological factors'\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nTo examine whether psychological factors (collectively) are associated with more/less probability of completing the couchto5k programme, we can compare our model:  \n```{r}\ncompmod <- glm(completed ~ season + age + city + accountabilityZ + selfmotZ, \n               data = couchto5k, family=binomial)\n```\n\nWith a restricted model that doesn't include them:\n```{r}\ncompmod0 <- glm(completed ~ season + age + city, data = couchto5k, family=binomial)\n\n```\n\n```{r}\nanova(compmod0, compmod, test=\"Chisq\")\n```\n\nbeyond participants' age, location and which season programme is undertaken in, psychological factors of accountability and self motivation _do_ appear to improve model fit  \n\nFrom our coefficients, we can see that this is likely being driven by an association between self-motivation and the probability of completing the couchto5k programme:  \n\n```{r}\nsummary(compmod)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(\"Visualising\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nIt's always worth visualising the two focal predictors in terms of predicted probability of completion.  \n\nNote that because so few people took part in autumn and winter, this introduces a lot of uncertainty if we try and get at the effect holding `season` at its proportion, so we might be better off just providing the plot for Spring, as that is the most frequent season that people start the programme.  \n```{r}\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nlibrary(effects)\np1 <- effect(c(\"selfmotZ\",\"season\"), compmod, xlevels=20) |>\n  as.data.frame() |>\n  filter(season==\"spring\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=selfmotZ,y=fit))+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper),alpha=.2) +\n  labs(title=\"Predicted probability of\\ncouch-to-5k completion\",x=\"Self Motivation (Z-scored)\",y=\"P(Completed)\")\n\np2 <- effect(c(\"accountabilityZ\",\"season\"), compmod, xlevels=20) |>\n  as.data.frame() |>\n  filter(season==\"spring\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=accountabilityZ,y=fit))+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper),alpha=.2) +\n  labs(title=\"Predicted probability of\\ncouch-to-5k completion\",x=\"Accountability (Z-scored)\",y=\"P(Completed)\")\n\np1 + p2\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r solbegin(\"Writing up\", slabel=FALSE, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nres3 = anova(compmod0, compmod, test=\"Chisq\")\nres4 = exp(car::Confint(compmod))\nres4 = apply(res4,2, function(x) round(x,2))\n```\n\nCouch-to-5k completion (completed vs dropped out) was modelled using logistic regression, with the location (Glasgow, Edinburgh) and season in which participants undertake the programme as predictors, along with participants age, and their scores on two psychometric measures of accountability and self-motivation that were administered prior to participants starting the programme. A likelihood ratio test indicated that the inclusion of these two measures (accountability and self-motivation) collectively improves model fit over and above age, location and season ($\\chi^2(`r res3[2,3]`) = `r round(res3[2,4],2)`, \\, p = `r round(res3[2,5],3)`$). All deviance residuals for the full model were less than 3 in magnitude. \n\nIn keeping with previous research, completion of the programme was found to differ between seasons, with participants undertaking the programme in both summer and autumn being associated with increased odds of programme completion ($OR: `r res4[2,1]`$, $95\\% CI [`r paste0(res4[2,2:3],collapse=\", \")`]$ and $`r res4[3,1]`$ $[`r paste0(res4[3,2:3],collapse=\", \")`]$ respectively). Age and city were not found to significantly predict completion.  \n\nWhile completing the programme was not significantly associated with scores on the accountability measure, a relationship was found between self motivation and programme completion; a 1 standard deviation increase in self-motivation was associated with doubling the odds of finishing the entire 9-weeks ($OR: `r res4[8,1]`\\, [`r paste0(res4[8,2:3],collapse=\", \")`]$). The model-predicted probabilities of programme completion across values of the two psychometric measures are visualised in @fig-couchglm. Full table of results can be found in @tbl-couchglmcoef  \n\nThe present study indicated that the psychometric factors of accountability and self motivation, taken together, were useful in predicting the completion (vs drop out) of the couch-to-5k programme.
