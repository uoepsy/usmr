We have been starting by considering what a given statistic is *likely to be* if a given hypothesis (the null) were true.\n    - For the $t$-tests, if the null hypothesis is true (there is no difference between group means/between our observed mean and some value), then our $t$-statistics (if we could do our study loads of times) will mainly fall around 0, and follow a $t$-distribution. The precise $t$-distribution depends on the degrees of freedom, which in turn depends on how much data we have.  \n    - For the $\\chi^2$ tests, if the null hypothesis is true and there is no difference between the observed and expected frequencies, then our $\\chi^2$-statistics will follow the $\\chi^2$ distribution (i.e., with 2 categories, most of them will be between 0 and 2, with fewer falling >2, see the yellow line in @fig-chidist2).   \n    \n- Step 2. We calculate our statistic from our *observed* data.  \n\n- Step 3. We ask what the probability is of getting a statistic at least as extreme as we get from Step 2, assuming the null hypothesis we stated in Step 1.\n\n:::column-margin\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Chi-Square Distributions](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Chi-square_pdf.svg/1200px-Chi-square_pdf.svg.png){#fig-chidist2 fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n:::lo\n**If you're finding the programming easy, but the statistical concepts difficult**\n\nAnother way which *might* help to think about this is that if we can make a computer do something over and over again, we can do stats! You may already be familiar with this idea from exercises with the function `replicate()`!  \n\n<div style=\"width:60%; display: inline-block\">\n\n1. make the computer generate random data, based on some null hypothesis.

This is $p$. The only difference between this and \"statistics\" is that we calculate $p$ using math, rather than having to generate random data. \n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Statistical vs Practical Significance\n\nLet's suppose that an agricultural company is testing out a new fertiliser they have developed to improve tomato growth. They know that, on average, for every 5cm taller a tomato plant is, it tends to provide 1 more tomato. Taller plants = more tomatoes.  \n\nThey plant 1000 seeds (taken from the same tomato plant) in the same compost and place them in positions with the same amount of sunlight. 500 of the plants receive 100ml of water daily, and the other 500 receive a 100ml of the fertiliser mixed with water. After 100 days, they measure the height of all the tomato plants (in cm).  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/moretests/playmotom.jpg){fig-align='left' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou can find the data at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/tomatogrowth.csv. \n\nWe want to conduct the appropriate test to determine whether the fertiliser provides a statistically significant improvement to tomato plant growth.  \nOur outcome variable is growth, which is continuous, and our predictor variable is the grouping (whether they received fertiliser or not). So we're looking at whether there is a difference in mean growth between the two groups. A t-test will do here.  \n\nOur alternative hypothesis is that the difference in means $(treatment - control)$ is greater than 0 (i.e., it improves growth). The `t.test()` function will use alphabetical ordering of the `group` variable, so if we say `alternative=\"less\"` then it is the direction we want $(control - treatment < 0)$:^[We could instead make the `group` variable a factor and specify the order of the levels]:  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntomato <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/tomatogrowth.csv\")\nt.test(tomato$height ~ tomato$group, alternative = \"less\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tWelch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  tomato$height by tomato$group\nt = -2.0085, df = 997.97, p-value = 0.02243\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group control and group treatment is less than 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n       -Inf -0.2296311\nsample estimates:\n  mean in group control mean in group treatment \n               115.1955                116.4692 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHooray, it is significant! So should we use this fertiliser on all our tomatoes? We need to carefully consider the agricultural company's situation: given that the fertiliser is comparitively pricey for them to manufacture, is it worth putting into production?  \n\nWhile the fertiliser does improve plant growth to a statistically significant (at $\\alpha=0.05$) degree, the improvement is minimal. The difference in means is only 1.2737cm. Will this result in many more tomatoes? Probably not.    \n\nFurthermore, if we take a look at the *confidence interval* provided by the `t.test()` function, we can see that a plausible value for the *true difference* in means is 0.23cm, which is tiny!\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Further Thoughts\n\nThe above example is just a silly demonstration that whether or not our p-value is below some set criteria (e.g., .05, .01, .001) is only a small part of the picture. There are many things which are good to remember about p-values:\n\n1. With a big enough sample size, even a tiny tiny effect is detectable at <.05. For example, you might be interested in testing if the difference in population means across two groups is 0 ($\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$. Your calculated sample difference could be $\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2 = 0.00002$ but with a very small p-value of 0.00000001. This would tell you that there is strong evidence that the observed difference in means (0.00002) is significantly different from 0. However, the practical difference, that is - the magnitude of the distance between 0.00002 and 0 - is negligible and of pretty much no interest to practitioners. This is the idea we saw in the tomato-plant example. \n  \n2. The criteria ($\\alpha$) which we set (at .05, .01, etc.), is *arbitrary*.  \nTwo things need to be kept in mind: there is the true status of the world (which is unknown to us) and the collected data (which are available and reveal the truth only in part).  \nAn observed p-value smaller than the chosen alpha does not imply the true presence of an effect. The observed difference might be due to sampling variability.  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two possible samples (blue dots) drawn from two populations with same mean. On the left, the selected sample shows a big difference. On the right, the sample shows no difference. Samples such as that on the left are very unlikely to happen (e.g., 5% of the time). It is for these unlikely samples that we would reject the null hypothesis incorrectly 5% of the time.](images/moretests/samples.png){#fig-samplesmore fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n  \n3. Even if a null hypothesis about the population is actually true, then 5% (if $\\alpha$ = 0.05) of the test-statistics computed on different samples from that population would result in a p-value <.05. If you were to obtain 100 random samples from that population, five out of the 100 p-values are likely to be <.05 *even if the null hypothesis about the population was actually true*.  \n\n4. If you have a single dataset, and you perform several tests of hypotheses on those data, each test comes with a probability of incorrectly rejecting the null (making a *type I error*) of 5%. Hence, considering the entire family of tests computed, your overall type I error probability will be larger than 5%. In simple words, this means that if you perform enough tests on the same data, youâ€™re almost sure to reject one of the null hypotheses by mistake. This concept is known as **multiple comparisons**.  \n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Further Reading (Optional)\n\nThere are many different competing approaches to doing statistical analyses.  \nIn this course we are learning about what is known as the *frequentist* framework. Roughly speaking, this is where probabilities are defined as \"long-run frequencies\" (i.e., the probability of $x$ happening over many many trials^[For those of you who are interested in what alternative definitions there are, do a google search for \"frequentist vs bayesian\". Be prepared that this will open a big can of worms!]). Even within the *frequentist* approach, there are different views as to how to how this definition of probability is best utilised.  \n  \nThe following links provide some introductory readings to some of the different schools of thought:  \n\n1.
