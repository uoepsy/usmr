# Binary Predictors 

use example from 07a 

# Categorical predictors with k-levels  

TODO use example from 08a

# WTF is a "Contrast Matrix"?  

1. set as factor
remember, factors have little extra info, such as "levels" 
they also have "contrasts": 

# Different types of contrasts  


## Treatment Contrasts (the default)

intuition: "each level compared to a reference level"  
"each treatment compared to the placebo"  

if a character, not a factor in the data, lm will interpret it as factor with treatment contrasts in the model.  


## Sum Contrasts

intuition "each level compared to the overall mean"
