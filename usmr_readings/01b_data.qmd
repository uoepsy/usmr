This reading:  

- How does R store data?  
- What can R _do_ with data?  
- How can we use R to access and manipulate data?  

:::


# Vectors  

We've already seen how to assign a value to a name/symbol using `<-`. However, we've only seen how to assign a single number, e.g:   
```{r}
x <- 5 # assign the value 5 to the name "x"
x # print the object named "x"
```

In almost all cases, the data we are working with will be more than just an individual number. We might have measured the IQ of 20 different people, in which case we have 20 numbers representing IQ scores. More commonly, we work with 2-Dimensional arrays of numbers, e.g. each row is an observation, and each column represents something we have measured.  

To store a sequence of numbers into R, we can _combine_ the values using `c()` and give the sequence a name. A sequence of elements all of the same type is called a **vector**.  
As before, to view the stored content, we simply type the name of the vector:   

```{r}
myfirstvector <- c(1, 5, 3, 7)
myfirstvector
```

We can perform arithmetic operations on each value of the vector.  
For example, to add five to each entry:
```{r}
myfirstvector + 5
```

To reiterate, vectors are sequences of elements **all of the same type**. 
A vectors does not have to be a sequence of numbers, it could be a sequence of words, such as the names of different types of animals.  
Words need to be written inside quotations, e.g. "anything", and instead of being of numeric type, we say they are characters.

```{r}
wordsvector <- c("cat", "dog", "parrot", "peppapig")
wordsvector
```

:::rtip
You can use either double-quote or single-quote:
```{r}
c("cat", "dog", "parrot", "horse")
c('cat', 'dog', 'parrot', 'horse')
```
:::

It does not make sense to add a number to words, hence some operations like addition and multiplication are only defined on vectors of numeric type. If you make a mistake, R will warn you with a red error message.

```{r}
#| eval: false
wordsvector + 5
```
<p style="color:red">
Error in wordsvector + 5 : non-numeric argument to binary operator
</p>

Finally, it is important to notice that if you combine together in a vector a number and a word, R will transform all elements to be of the same type. 
Why? Recall: vectors are sequences of elements **all of the same type**.
Typically, R chooses the most general type between the two. 
In the example below, it makes everything a __character__ (letters) (note the `"` around the 4), as it is unclear how to transform "cat" into a number! 

```{r}
mysecondvector <- c(4, "cat")
mysecondvector
```



<div class="divider div-transparent div-dot"></div>

# Dataframes

Now we have seen how we can store a set of values into a vector in R, we can move to thinking about data in a more intuitive way.  

Typically, when we imagine "collecting data", we imagine asking a sample of people a bunch of questions (e.g. we might ask them their height, age, hair colour etc). So we could have a vector of heights, another vector of ages, and another of hair colours. 

Rather than storing all of these as separate objects, it makes a lot more sense to organise them in two dimensions, very much like a spreadsheet. In R, a collection of vectors is termed a "dataframe"

:::sticky
**Dataframes** are simply collections of vectors of the same length.   

Typically, all vectors are ordered to ensure that a given row represents the characteristics of a single observation

![](images/installing_intro/dataframe.jpg)
:::

For instance, we could imagine a dataframe containing information on the name and birth year of each member of The Beatles. The easiest way to think of this would be to have a row for each Beatle, and a column for each of their names and their birth-years. Note that each vector contains all the same type of information (the names are all strings of characters, and the birth years are all numbers).  

:::rtip
We _can_, if we want to, create a dataframe inside R, by giving it a collection of vectors:  
```{r}
data.frame(
  name = c("john","paul","george","ringo"),
  birth_year = c(1940,1942,1943,1940)
)
```
:::

While we can manually create data like above, more often we will need to _import_ into R some data which has been created elsewhere (like in excel, or by some software which is used to present participants with experiments, or collect responses to questionnaires).  

Let's suppose we have instead entered data in something like Microsoft Excel, or LibreOffice Calc, or whatever spreadsheet software we have available (@fig-excel).  
```{r}
#| label: fig-excel
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Data entered in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel"
#| out-width: "49%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/installing_intro/create_data.png")
```
We can then save that data as a __.csv__ file. Although R can read data when it's saved in Microsoft/LibreOffice formats, the simplest, and most universal way to save data is as simple text, with the values separated by some character. The __.csv__ format stands for __comma separated values.__^[To save as .csv in Microsoft Excel, we go to __File > Save as__, and then in the Save as Type box, choose to save the file as __CSV (Comma delimited)__]  

Back in RStudio, we need to have a way of getting the information contained in that file _into_ R's environment, so that we can do things with it. We can do this by using the `read.csv()` function, and directing it to the file you just saved.  

:::hints
_note: if you are using RStudio on a server - i.e. accessing it via a web-browser - then you will need to upload the file you just saved to the server (see the "upload" button in the Files tab in the bottom right pane of R)._
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
read.csv("data_from_excel.csv")
```
```{r}
#| echo: false
read.csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/data_from_excel.csv")
```

:::rtip
__Helpful tip__   

If you have your text-cursor inside the quotation marks, and press the tab key on your keyboard, it will show you the files inside your project. You can then use the arrow keys to choose between them and press Enter to add the code.  

:::


There's one more thing that we need to do, and that is to actually store this information in our environment. Currently, it is just printing out the data. We need to assign it a name:  
```{r}
#| echo: false
beatles <- read.csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/data_from_excel.csv")
```
```{r}
#| eval: false
beatles <- read.csv("data_from_excel.csv")
```

We should now have something called "beatles" which is visible in the _environment_ pane of RStudio (top right).  

And we can print it out by simply invoking its name:  
```{r}
beatles
```

And we can do things such as ask R how many rows and columns there are (asking for the "dimensions" using `dim()`):
```{r}
dim(beatles)
```

This says that there are 4 members of the Beatles, and for each we have 2 measurements (name and birth-year).

To get more insight into what the data actually are, you can either use `str()` to see the structure:
```{r}
str(beatles)
```



<div class="divider div-transparent div-dot"></div>

# Functions  

We've just seen some use of `c()`, `read.csv()`, `dim()` and `str()`.  

There's something that all these things have in common - they are __functions.__  

:::sticky
__Functions__ perform specific operations / transformations in computer programming.  
  
They can have __inputs__ and __outputs__. For example, `dim()` takes some data you have stored in R as its __input__, and gives the dimensions of the data as its __output__.
:::


There are loads and loads of functions in R. This is really where the power lies. Here is a demonstration of a couple of basic ones. Hopefully you can guess what they are doing?    
```{r}
myfirstvector <- c(1, 5, 3, 7)
sum(myfirstvector)
mean(myfirstvector)
```

:::rtip
__Getting Help on Functions__

Almost all functions in R will have associated documentation describing what they do. If we don't know what a function does, we can read the help docs by typing a question mark and then the function name, and running it in R. `?mean` will bring up a little help page in the bottom-right pane of RStudio

# R Packages

Alongside the basic installation of R and RStudio, there are many add-on packages which the R community create and maintain. The thousands of packages are part of what makes R such a powerful and useful tool - there is a package for almost everything you could want to do in R.  

:::sticky
__Packages__ are bundles of functions, code, data, documentation, etc.  

To install a package onto our computer we use `install.packages("package name")`.  
Then, any time that we want to use that package we just need to load it into our current R session with `library(package name)`.   

```{r}
#| label: fig-libraries
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "60%"
#| fig-cap: "Source: [@visnut](https://twitter.com/visnut/status/1248087845589274624)"
knitr::include_graphics("images/installing_intro/libraries.jpeg")
```
:::

:::frame
<center>__Example: Installing and using a package__</center>    

Here we're going to install a silly package called __cowsay__:  

Write this code **directly into the console** and run it:  
```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("cowsay")
```
This spits out a lot of messages, before (hopefully) ending with something similar to: 

<p style="color:red;margin-left:30px;">
...<br>
...<br>
\* DONE (cowsay)<br>
<br>
The downloaded source packages are in<br>
	\‘/tmp/RtmpIRbMnh/downloaded_packages\’
</p>
<span style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">\></span>

Now that we've installed it, to use it we just need to load it into our R session, by using `library()`.  
**Back in your script**, use this code to load the package:
```{r}
library(cowsay)
```

Which enables us to now use some of the functionality that is in that package, such as the `say()` function, which makes some silly art out of punctuation symbols:  
```{r}
say("Welcome to the USMR course!", by = "owl")
```


:::


<div style="max-width:49%;display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle">
It's good practice to have all the packages you use for an analysis loaded at the top of your script.  
  
A typical structure for an R script is to:  

1. load all the required packages
2. read in the data
3. conduct your analysis    

</div><div style="max-width:49%;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top">
```{r}  
#| label: fig-packload
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Typical script layout"
knitr::include_graphics("images/installing_intro/packload.png")
```
</div>

:::rtip

We will be using these packages quite a lot in this course, so you might want to install them now, by writing `install.packages("PACKAGE_NAME")` in your console:  

- tidyverse
- patchwork

It might take a few minutes for them to install, so just sit back and take a breather. 


:::


<div class="divider div-transparent div-dot"></div>

# Checkpoint - where are you writing your code?  

Hopefully, if you are following along with us, you are writing almost all of your code in a script, and not in the console. __Remember: Code that you write in the console is *not* saved__.  

However, when we installed packages above, we suggested you write directly into the console.  
Why? Because sometimes, for certain things, we don't want to keep a record of that bit of code. We only ever want to install a package __once__, because after that first time it's going to be installed on our computer, so we're not going to need to run `install.packages("cowsay")` again. 

Consider the example code below. The 2nd, 3rd, and 5th lines do absolutely nothing to our computations with x and y. They are just for our own workings. Because lines like this have no consequences on code below, our R script will have the same end-point with and without those line.  
```{r}
#| eval: false
x <- 4
x
4*33
y <- 6/100
?mean
answer <- x*y
```

In general, the vast majority of the code you write will be in the script, and you will only use the console occasionally for quick commands that aren't doing anything to change our analysis. For example, we don't want to keep **re-**installing packages over and over again (each time we run a script), so we'll tend to use `install.packages()` in the console. Similarly, when we look up the help documentation for a function (e.g. by running `?mean`), we type that into the console, and not a script.  

This will become second nature as you use R more and more, but it's helpful to get into good habits early on.   

:::sticky
__Rules of thumb__  

- If a line of code changes something in the environment, then that code should be written in the script.  
- If you clear your environment, restart R, and run your script all at once (see the section on ['Good Habits' in Section 1A](01a_R.html#Good_Habits){target="_blank"}), it shouldn't produce errors and should get you back to your current place  

If we don't follow the above suggestions, then our work will not be **reproducible** (e.g. you send your script to someone and they will get a different answer from you when they run it).

# Basic Data Wrangling   



Now that we've started to learn about vectors and dataframes, we're going to look at reading in a bigger dataset, exploring some of the variables, and the syntax we can use to access and edit certain bits of the data.    

First we'll read in our data:  
```{r}
starwars2 <- read.csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/starwars2.csv")
```

:::rtip
__Reading data from a URL__ 

Note that when you have a url for some data (e.g. [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uoepsy/data/master/starwars2.csv)) you can read it in directly by giving functions like `read.csv()` the url inside quotation marks. 
:::

The data contains information on various characteristics of characters from Star Wars. 
We can print out the top of the data by using the `head()` function which displays the first six rows of the data by default. You could change this by saying, for example, `head(data, n = 10)`:
```{r}
head(starwars2, n = 10)
```

_(Don't worry about the_ NAs _for now, they are just how R tells you an entry is missing, i.e. Not Available.)_  

:::rtip
Try clicking on the data in your __environment__ (the top right window of RStudio). It will open the data in a tab in the editor window - this is another way of looking at the data, more like you would in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel.  

This can be time-consuming and awkward if your data file is big (i.e. lots of columns, or lots of rows, or both!).
:::

We can take a look at how big the data is (the dimensions), using `dim()`
```{r}
dim(starwars2)
```

We can see that there are `r nrow(starwars2)` rows and `r ncol(starwars2)` columns. In this dataset, each Star Wars character is an __observational unit__, and there are 6 __variables__ (things which vary between units) such as their _height_, _species_, _homeworld_, etc.  

:::sticky
__observations and variables__

The individual entities on which data are collected are called __observational units__ or __cases__. Often (but not always), these equate to the rows of a dataset.  

A __variable__ is any characteristic that varies from observational unit to observational unit (these are often the columns of the dataset)
:::

## Accessing subsets of data

What if we want to extract certain subsections of our dataset, such as specific observational units or variables? 
This is where we learn about two important bits of R code used to access parts of data - the dollar sign `$`, and the square brackets `[]`.  

:::rtip
__The dollar sign $__  
  
The dollar sign allows us to extract a specific variable from a dataframe.
For instance, we can pull out the variable named "eye_color" in the data, by using `$eye_color` after the name that we gave our dataframe.  

Remember that each variable in a dataframe is a vector (a set of values). Once extracted, we will have a vector and not a dataframe.  
```{r}
starwars2$eye_color
```
:::



:::rtip
__The square brackets []__  
  
Square brackets are used to do what is known as __indexing__ (finding specific entries in your data).  
We can retrieve bits of data by identifying the $i^{th}$ entry(s) inside the square brackets, for instance: 

```{r}
# assign the numbers 10, 20 ... 100 to the name "somevalues"
somevalues <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)

# pull out the 3rd entry
somevalues[3]
```

In the above example, we have a __vector__ (a single sequence of values), and so we can retrieve entries with the syntax:
<center> 
**vector[entry]**
</center>
<br>
In a __dataframe__ we have an extra dimension - we have rows _and_ columns. Using square brackets with a dataframe needs us to specify both:  
<center>
**dataframe[rows, columns]**
</center>
:::

Let's look at some examples: 

::: {.panelset}

::: {.panel}
#### Examples of Indexing

1. Specifying row number and column number:  
```{r}
#| eval: false

# first row, fourth column
starwars2[1, 4]
# tenth row, first column
starwars2[10, 1]
```
2. If we leave either rows or columns blank, then we will get out __all__ of them:
```{r}
#| eval: false
# tenth row, all columns
starwars2[10, ]
# all rows, 2nd column
starwars2[ , 2]
```
3. There are is another way to identify column - we can use the name in quotation marks:  
```{r}
#| eval: false
# first row, "species" column
starwars2[1, "species"]
```
4. We can also ask for multiple rows, or multiple columns, or both! To do that, we use `c()`:
```{r}
#| eval: false
# the 1st AND the 6th rows, and the 1st AND 3rd columns
starwars2[c(1,6), c(1,3)] 
```
5. And we can specify a sequence using the colon, `from:to`: ^[The colon operator, `from:to`, creates a vector from the value `from` to the value `to` in steps of 1.  
For instance, `1:6` is the same as `c(1,2,3,4,5,6)`.]

```{r}
#| eval: false
# FROM the 1st TO the 6th row, all columns
starwars2[1:6, ] 
```

6. We can even use the two accessors in combination:^[Note: When we do this, we don't have the comma inside the square brackets.  
When we use the `$` to pull out a variable, such as `starwars2$name`, we no longer have a dataframe.  
`starwars2$name` doesn't have rows and columns, it just has a series of values - _it's a vector!_  
So when you are using `[]` with a __vector__ (1 dimension) rather than a __dataframe__ (2 dimensions), you don't specify `[rows, columns]`, but simply `[entry]`.] 
```{r}
#| eval: false
# extract the variable called "name" and show the 20th entry
starwars2$name[20]  
```


:::
::: {.panel}
#### Show me the output

1. Specifying row number and column number:  
```{r}
# first row, fourth column
starwars2[1, 4]
# tenth row, first column
starwars2[10, 1]
```
2. If we leave either rows or columns blank, then we will get out __all__ of them:
```{r}
# tenth row, all columns
starwars2[10, ]
# all rows, 2nd column
starwars2[ , 2]
```
3. There are is another way to identify column - we can use the name in quotation marks:  
```{r}
# first row, "species" column
starwars2[1, "species"]
```
4. We can also ask for multiple rows, or multiple columns, or both! To do that, we use `c()`:
```{r}
# the 1st AND the 6th rows, and the 1st AND 3rd columns
starwars2[c(1,6), c(1,3)] 
```
5. And we can specify a sequence using the colon, `from:to`:  
```{r}
# FROM the 1st TO the 6th row, all columns
starwars2[1:6, ] 
```
6. We can even use the two accessors in combination: 
```{r}
# extract the variable called "name" and show the 20th entry
starwars2$name[20]  
```
:::

:::sticky
__The dollar sign $__ 

Used to extract a variable from a dataframe:   

+ `dataframe$variable`

__The square brackets []__

Used to extract parts of an R object by identifying rows and/or columns, or more generally, "entries". Left blank will return all. 

+ `vector[entries]`
+ `dataframe[rows, columns]`
:::

## Accessing by a condition 

We can also do something really useful, which is to access all the entries in the data for which _a specific condition_ is true.  

Let's take a simple example to start:
```{r}
somevalues <- c(10, 10, 0, 20, 15, 40, 10, 40, 50, 35)
```

To only select values which are greater than 20, we can use:
```{r}
somevalues[somevalues > 20]
```

:::frame
__Unpacking:__ `somevalues[somevalues > 20]`  
<br>
First, let's look at what `somevalues > 20` does. It returns TRUE for the entries of `somevalues` which are greater than 20, and FALSE for the entries of `somevalues` that are not (that is, which are less than, or equal to, 20. 

This statement `somevalues > 20` is called the __condition__.    
```{r}
somevalues > 20
```

Now consider putting that sequence of TRUEs and FALSEs inside the square brackets in `somevalues[]`.
This returns only the entries of `somevalues` for which the condition is `TRUE`.  
```{r}
somevalues[c(FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE)]
```

So what we're doing is using a __condition__ inside the square brackets to return all the values for which that condition is TRUE.

And we're being super efficient, because we don't want to write out TRUEs and FALSEs all day, so we just give the conditional question inside the brackets directly:  
```{r}
somevalues[somevalues > 20]
```

:::

<br>
We can extend this same logic to a dataframe.
Let's suppose we want to access all the entries in our Star Wars data who have the value "Droid" in the _species_ variable.
To work out how to do this, we first need a line of code which defines our __condition__ - one which returns `TRUE` for each entry of the _species_ variable which is "Droid", and `FALSE` for those that are not "Droid".  

We can use the dollar sign to pull out the _species_ variable: 
```{r}
starwars2$species
```

And we can ask R whether each value __is equal to__ "Droid"  

:::hints
*Remember:* in R, we ask whether something __is equal to__ something else by using a double-equals, `==`. A single equal sign would be wrong, as it denotes assignment.
:::

```{r}
starwars2$species == "Droid"
```

Finally, we can use this condition inside our square brackets to access the entries of the data for which this condition is TRUE:
```{r}
# I would read the code below as: 
# "In the starwars2 dataframe, give me all the rows 
# for which the condition starwars2$species=="Droid"
# is TRUE, and give me all the columns."

starwars2[starwars2$species == "Droid", ]
```

<!-- `r optbegin('Optional: with().', FALSE)` -->
<!-- A useful function is `with()`. This creates a "container" where the variables of the dataframe are available to R within the `with()` parentheses without the need to use `$`: -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- with(starwars2, starwars2[species == "Droid", ]) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- `r optend()` -->

## More complex conditions

Thinking back to Reading 1A when we first introduced R, we [talked briefly about "logical operators"](01a_R.html#R_is_a_calculator){target="_blank"}. Specifically, the operators `&`, `|`, and `!` (for "and", "or"," and "not"), will come in handy now.  

For instance, we can now extract all those in the dataset which are humans _and_ taller than 190cm:  
```{r}
# "In the starwars2 dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# condition starwars2$species=="Human" AND starwars2$height > 190 are TRUE, 
# and give me all the columns."
starwars2[starwars2$species == "Human" & starwars2$height > 190, ]
```
Or we can extract all those in the dataset which are _either_ droids _or_ ewoks: 
```{r}
# "In the starwars2 dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# condition starwars2$species=="Droid" OR starwars2$species=="Ewok" is TRUE, 
# and give me all the columns."
starwars2[starwars2$species == "Droid" | starwars2$species == "Ewok", ]
```
 

## Editing specific entries {-}  

Now that we've seen a few ways of _accessing_ sections of data, we can learn how to edit them! 
One of the most common reasons you will need to modify entries in your data is in __data cleaning__. This is the process of identifying incorrect / incomplete / irrelevant data, and replacing / modifying / deleting them. 

Above, we looked at the subsection of the data where the _species_ variable had the entry "Droid". Some of you may have noticed earlier that we had some data on C3PO. Are they not also a droid? 

<center>
![](images/categorical/c3po.png)  
</center>

(Looks pretty Droid-y to me! _disclaimer: I know nothing about Star Wars_ &#128578; )

Just as we saw above how to _access_ specific entries, e.g.: 
```{r}
# 2nd row, all columns
starwars2[2, ]
# 2nd row, 6th column (the "species" column)
starwars2[2,6]
```

We can change these by __assigning them a new value__ (remember the `<-` symbol). In doing so, we _overwrite_^[you could think of this as _replacing_ / _overwriting_ / _reassigning_ the entry] the entry in the 2nd row and 6th column of the data (`starwars2[2,6]`) with the value "Droid". 
```{r}
# C3PO is a droid, not a human
starwars2[2,6] <- "Droid"
# Look at the 2nd row now -
# the entry in the "species" column has changed:
starwars2[2, ]
```

## Editing entries via a condition {-}  

We saw above how to access parts of data by means of a __condition__, with code such as:

```{r}
# "In the starwars2 dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# condition starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE, and give me all the columns."
starwars2[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo", ]
```

What if we wanted to modify it so that every character from "Naboo" was actually of species "Nabooian"?  

We can do that in a number of ways, all of which do the same thing - namely, they access parts of the data and assign them the new value "Nabooian".  

The lines of code below all do exactly that, in different ways. We've also tried to give a way of interepreting each line. 

```{r}
# In the starwars2 data, give the rows for which condition 
# starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE, and select only the "species" column. 
# Assign to these selected entries the value "Nabooian".
starwars2[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo", "species"] <- "Nabooian"
```

```{r}
# In the starwars2 data, give the rows for which condition 
# starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE, and select only the 6th column. 
# Assign to these selected entries the value "Nabooian".
starwars2[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo", 6] <- "Nabooian"
```

```{r}
# Extract the species variable from the starwars2 data (it's a vector).
# Pick the entries for which the condition starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE.
# Assign to these selected entries the value "Nabooian".
starwars2$species[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo"] <- "Nabooian"
```

In a similar way, we could have changed C-3PO to a Droid without ever having to know what row of the data they were in! 
```{r}
# for the row(s) where the name variable in starwars2
# is equal to "C-3PO", in the species variable we assign
# that entry to be "Droid"
starwars2[starwars2$name=="C-3PO", "species"] <- "Droid"
```

## Adding/Changing a variable

Another thing we might want to do is change a whole variable (a whole column) in some way.  
The logic is exactly the same, for instance, we can take the variable "height" from the dataframe "starwars2", dividing it by 100 via `starwars2$height / 100`, and then assign the result to the same variable name in the data, i.e. we overwrite the column: 
```{r}
starwars2$height <- starwars2$height / 100
```

We could instead have added a _new column_ named "height_m" with those values if we did not want to overwrite "height":
```{r}
#| eval: false
starwars2$height_m <- starwars2$height / 100
```
This would have left the "height" variable as-is, and created a new one called "height2" which was the values in "height" divided by 100. 


## Removing rows or columns

Lastly, we might want to change the data by removing a row or a column.
Again, the logic remains the same, in that we use `<-` to assign the edited data to a name (either a new name, thus creating a new object, or an existing name, thereby _overwriting_ that object).  
  
For instance, notice that the 35th and 75th rows of our data probably aren't a valid observation - I'm reasonably sure that Marge and Homer Simpson never appeared in Star Wars:
```{r}
starwars2[c(35,75), ]
```

We can remove a certain row(s) by using a minus sign `-` inside the square brackets 
```{r}
#| eval: false
# everything minus the 75th row
starwars2[-75, ]
# everything minus the (35th and 75th rows)
starwars2[-c(35, 75), ]
```

And we can simply _re-use_ the name "starwars2" to overwrite the data and make this change take effect (rather than just print out the result, which the code above did):
```{r}
starwars2 <- starwars2[-c(35, 75), ]
```
(now, in the __environment__ pane of Rstudio, the object named "starwars2" will say 73 observations, rather than 75, which it had before - we've removed the 2 rows)   

<br>
The same logic applies for columns:
```{r}
# Create a new object called "anonymous_starwars2" and assign it 
# to the values which are the "starwars2" dataframe minus the 
# 1st column (the "name" column):
anonymous_starwars2 <- starwars2[, -1]
# dimensions of our initial data
dim(starwars2)
# the data we just assigned has one fewer columns
dim(anonymous_starwars2)
```
