title: "Linear Models"
---

These readings and walkthroughs take you from complete basics of R and statistics up to **the linear model**, one of the most foundational methods in statistics. We will see how we can visualise and describe patterns in sample data, before discussing how we can infer from those samples to talk about the broader population of interest. Following examples of the more common basic statistical tests to describe relationships between two variables, we then move on to the main course of the linear model, before finishing up with a taster of how this method can be extended to other scenarios.  


Readings and walkthroughs are presented with accompanying R code.
