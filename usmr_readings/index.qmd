title: "Linear Models"
---

These readings and walkthroughs take you from complete basics of R and statistics up to **the linear model**, one of the most foundational methods in statistics. We will see how we can visualise and describe patterns in sample data, before discussing how we can infer from those samples to talk about the broader population of interest. Following examples of the more common basic statistical tests to describe relationships between two variables, we then move on to the main course of the linear model, before finishing up with a taster of how this method can be extended to other scenarios.  


Readings and walkthroughs are presented with accompanying R code.  

<!-- A lot of the tools used to make these resources rely on the hard work of others who have been generous enough to share ideas and examples. With Quarto and WebAssembly and webr doing the heavy lifting, specific mentions should be made to the webexercises and gradethis packages, and jmclawson for his tutorial on how to get things working.   -->
