Typically the analyses taught in this course are relevant for when there is just one source of variation - i.e. when we are interested in a single outcome measured across a set of independent observations. The first half of the course covers the fundamentals of statistical inference using a simulation-based approach, and introduces students to working with R & RStudio. The latter half of the course focuses on the general linear model, emphasising the fact that many statistical methods are simply special cases of this approach. This course introduces students to statistical modelling and empowers them with tools to analyse richer data and answer a broader set of research questions."

    "text": "Clean and describe\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nHave a look at the data. Check for impossible values and deal with these in an appropriate manner. Describe the data, either in words or using suitable graphs (or a combination).\nWrite it up! Remember to detail the decisions you have made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto clean data, go through each variable in turn. If numeric, what is the min and max? If categorical, what are the possible levels?\n\nto describe data, you might want to use tables and plots, or you might find describing in text can work too.\n\nThere’s no right way to deal with missing values.\n\none option is to cross-tabulate the reasons for missingness, and then remove them from the dataset at this point. This means all your analyses are conducted on the same set of “complete cases”. This can be the neat and tidy option, but if some variables have lots of missingness, you might end up needlessly limiting some of your analyses in terms of statistical power.\nanother option is to leave all missing values in the dataset and let them be dealt with by each of your model(s) and test(s). The downside of this is that different tests end up being performed on different subsets of data, making it harder to describe (it also means you need to be very careful with model comparisons)\n\nThere’s no right way to deal with outliers.\n\nSome fields of research will identify at the outset any observations that are outlying by looking at each variable individually. These they will then remove, or scale back (6A #outliers) prior to any analysis. This should really only be done if you are sure that these observations are outlying because of either a) measurement error or b) not belonging to the target population of interest. If the outlyingness could well simply be natural variation in the variable, keep it in. You can always then examine its influence on subsequent analyses!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore\n\n\n\nSolution 1. \n\ncouchto5k &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/couchto5k.csv\")\n\nGoing through each variable:\n\nage is an integer variable, shouldn’t have negative values by definition of variable.

Specifically, they would like to investigate whether dropping out of the programme early (prior to week 5), late (week 5 onwards) or not at all (completed all 9 weeks), is different between Edinburgh and Glasgow participants. They would also like to know if the average age of participants is different between the cities.\nPerform any appropriate analyses and write up your methods and results, providing plots and tables where useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two questions here: city differences in dropout, and city differences in age. These are nice and simple questions about the relationships between only two variables.\n\nYou might need to make a new variable for “early/late/no dropout”.\n\nThe first 5 weeks of the course focused on some of the more fundamental tests of relationships between two variables. Some of these might be useful here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting City Dropouts\n\n\n\nSolution 4. The dropout ~ city question is asking us to categorise when participants stop the programme into “early”, “late”, or “not at all”. So the question is categorical ~ categorical. Sounds like a \\(\\chi^2\\) test to me!\n\ncouchto5k &lt;- \n  couchto5k |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      dropout = ifelse(week_stopped &lt; 5, \"early\",\n                      ifelse(week_stopped &lt;9, \"late\", \"not at all\"))\n    )\n\nlet’s check that the above ifelse statement worked as we wanted:\n\ntable(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$week_stopped)\n\n            \n              1  2  3  4  5  7  8  9\n  early      12 10 10 14  0  0  0  0\n  late        0  0  0  0  3  5  4  0\n  not at all  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 58\n\n\nand let’s look at the differences between the cities, and also perform a \\(\\chi^2\\) test. We’re going to simulate the p-value here, because some of our expected cell counts are going to be \\(&lt;5\\) (see e.g. Week 4 Exercises #favourite-colours)\n\ntable(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city)\nchisq.test(table(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city), simulate.p.value = TRUE)\n\n\n\n            \n             Edinburgh Glasgow\n  early             34      12\n  late               8       4\n  not at all        43      15\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 2000\n    replicates)\n\ndata:  table(couchto5k$dropout, couchto5k$city)\nX-squared = 0.29923, df = NA, p-value = 0.9055\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting City Differences in Age\n\n\n\nSolution 5. The age ~ city question, on the other hand, is asking whether a continuous variable is different between two groups (Edinburgh and Glasgow). We can do this with a \\(t\\)-test!\nLet’s first assess the extent to which the ages of two groups of participants (Edinburgh folk and Glasgow folk) have similar variances (an assumption of the standard t-test), as well as the extent to which they are normally distributed:\n\nhist(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Edinburgh\"], \n     main = \"Edinburgh\", xlab = \"Age\")\nhist(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Glasgow\"], \n     main = \"Glasgow\", xlab = \"Age\")\n\nqqnorm(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Edinburgh\"], main = \"Edinburgh\")\nqqline(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Edinburgh\"])\n\nqqnorm(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Glasgow\"], main = \"Glasgow\")\nqqline(couchto5k$age[couchto5k$city==\"Glasgow\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese look almost okay to me. Not great, but not completely awful. We should bear in mind that we have &gt;30 participants in each group, which means we can be a little more relaxed about requiring very close to normal data.\nThe test of equal variances suggests we have no reason to reject the hypothesis that the two groups have equal variances:\n\nvar.test(age ~ city, data = couchto5k)\n\n\n    F test to compare two variances\n\ndata:  age by city\nF = 1.2079, num df = 84, denom df = 30, p-value = 0.5703\nalternative hypothesis: true ratio of variances is not equal to 1\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.6361894 2.1058008\nsample estimates:\nratio of variances \n          1.207877 \n\n\nSo we can carry on with our t-test of the difference in means1:\n\nt.test(age ~ city, data = couchto5k, var.equal = TRUE)\n\n\n    Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  age by city\nt = 1.2222, df = 114, p-value = 0.2242\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Edinburgh and group Glasgow is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -1.790235  7.557218\nsample estimates:\nmean in group Edinburgh   mean in group Glasgow \n               40.27059                37.38710 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting up\n\n\n\nSolution 6. A \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence indicated that rate of attrition (early-/late-/no- dropout) did not significantly differ between Edinburgh and Glasgow (\\(\\chi^2\\)(n=116) = 0.299, Monte Carlo simulated (B=2000) p = 0.906). From both cities, approximately half of participants did not drop out of the programme, late drop-outs made up 13% of Glasgow participants and 9% of those from Edinburgh, with the remainder dropping out early (39% of Glasgow, 40% of Edinburgh).\nThe mean age of participants was not significantly different between the two cities (\\(t( 114 )=1.22\\), \\(p=0.22\\)), with a mean age in Edinburgh of 40.3 and in Glasgow of 37.4."

    "text": "Happiness, Health, and a 5k Run\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nResearchers would like you to examine whether, beyond seasonal and age-related variation, happiness ratings are influenced by how far participants get through the couchto5k programme. Note that they are interested specifically in whether - and how - the effects of couchto5k progression are amplified by feeling healthy, such that getting further along in the programme might lead to greater increases in happiness when people are healthier.\nPerform an appropriate analysis and write up your methods and results, providing plots and tables where useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of the word “beyond” here should cue us to be thinking in terms of multiple regression. The question is asking about the relationship between happiness and couchto5k progression after we account for participants’ ages and the season in which they took the programme.\n\nWe also have a clear suggestion of an interaction here, because it asks about an effect of one predictor on the outcome (programme progression on happiness) being “amplified” (i.e. different) by another predictor (health)\nThis feels a bit like two questions, but the latter really supersedes the first - if we have an interaction, then the question of “what is the effect of progression on happiness?” can only really be answered with “it depends..”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting model(s)\n\n\n\nSolution 7. let’s standardise the health measure, because we probably don’t want to look at things where people have health of 0, and i’m not sure that an increase of 1 is that meaningful..\n\ncouchto5k &lt;- couchto5k |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    healthZ = (health-mean(health))/sd(health),\n  )\n\nHere’s our model:\n\nhhmod &lt;- lm(happiness ~ age + season + week_stopped * healthZ, couchto5k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Assumptions\n\n\n\nSolution 8. let’s take a look at assumptions\n\nplot(hhmod)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nso this looks a little weird - we’ve got some sharp ‘edges’ to our cloud of data in the residual vs fitted plot.\nWhat I think this is reflecting is that we are being limited by the bounds of the happiness measure (i.e. people are using the full scale of 0 up to 100). Consider how this might influence the residuals. As predicted values get closer to the edges of the scale, the residuals will get smaller. This might not be too much of a problem, but may well be worth discussing.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n\n\n\nSolution 9.

To investigate the extent to which, over and above seasonal and age related differences, happiness ratings are associated with getting further through (and feeling healthier following) the couch-to-5k programme, happiness ratings on a scale of 0 to 100 were modelled using multiple regression.\nThe number of weeks at which participants stopped (1-9), a multi-test measure of health (Z-scored) and their interaction were included as predictors, along with the covariates of age (years) and season (treatment coded with spring as the reference level). The regression model appeared to meet all assumptions, with residuals displaying a constant mean at approximately zero, although the boundaries of the happiness scale induced a smaller residual variance at the tail ends of the fitted values (see Appendix X). This is corroborated by 30% of participants reporting happiness in either the bottom or top 10th of the scale.\nAnalysis of variance indicated that after accounting for season and age, there was a significant interaction between participants’ self-reported health at the end of the programme and the week at which they stopped (\\(F(1,108)=30.69\\), \\(p &lt;0.001\\)). The full model explained approximately 24% (adjusted \\(R^2\\)) of the variance in happiness scores.\nFor those of average health, there was no statistically reliable change in happiness associated with additional weeks of the couch-to-5k programme (\\(b = 1.69\\), \\(\\beta = 0.16\\), \\(t(108) = \\, 1.32\\), \\(p = 0.191\\)).\nHowever this effect was moderated by health such that the weekly change in happiness was more positive for healthier, and more negative for less healthy, people. For each 1SD (10 raw points) change in health from the average, happiness ratings changed by an additional 5.03 points every week (\\(b = 5.03\\), \\(\\beta = 0.48\\), \\(t(108) = \\, 5.54\\), \\(p &lt;0.001\\)). Figure 1 shows the shape of this interaction, and a full regression table can be found in Table 1.\nHappiness following the couch-to-5k programme was found to be related to how far through the programme participants got, and this relationship depended on participant health, with the happiness of healthier participants increasing more for every week longer through the programme they lasted than it did for participants of average health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Interaction between health and duration completed of couch-to-5k on happiness, estimated for the average age and commencing the programme in Spring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Happiness ratings (0-100).

Sounds like a binary outcome!\n\nRecall (from study description above) that completing the programme has previously been found to vary substantially across the year. We may well therefore want to account for this in our model!\n\nWhat variables do we have that measure “psychological factors” that might influence dropping out? (pay attention to when each variable is measured!)\n\nHow might we visualise the results?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome Variable\n\n\n\nSolution 13.

So what is going into our model? We know that we’re interested in the ‘psychological factors’ (i.e. the variables accountability and selfmot), so at the very least we will have dropout ~ ?? + accountability + selfmot.\nBut what about controlling for other variables?\nPer the study description, many of these were measured after participants stopped programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nwhen\n\n\n\n\npptID\nNA\n\n\nage\nunclear when measured, but assume it is consistent at both points\n\n\naccountability\nmeasured at start\n\n\nselfmot\nmeasured at start\n\n\nhealth\nmeasured at end\n\n\nhappiness\nmeasured at end\n\n\nseason\nmeasured at start\n\n\ncity\nunclear when measured, but assume it is consistent at both points\n\n\nweek_stopped\nmeasured at end\n\n\ndropout\nmeasured at end\n\n\ncompleted\nmeasured at end\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t really make sense for us to think about your happiness after the programme influencing whether or not you complete it (this is not to say that it will not be associated).\nage, season and city are all things that might influence completion, or might influence predictors of interest like accountability or self-motivation. We know specifically that season has previously been found to influence completion, so it would be good to at least include that. I can think up some argument that older people are more motivated/hold themselves more accountable, and so I might want to control for age to ensure I am looking at the independent effects of these psychological features separate from any age effects.\nIt’s probably worth scaling the accountability and selfmot variables. They are both the sum of 7 questions, each scored 1-5, so it’s slightly unclear what a “1 unit increase” really means. It’s answering.\n\ncouchto5k &lt;-\n  couchto5k |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    accountabilityZ = scale(accountability)[,1],\n    selfmotZ = scale(selfmot)[,1]\n  )\n\nAnd here’s a model!\n\ncompmod &lt;- glm(completed ~ season + age + city + accountabilityZ + selfmotZ, \n               data = couchto5k, family=binomial)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the influence of ‘psychological factors’\n\n\n\nSolution 15.

It’s always worth visualising the two focal predictors in terms of predicted probability of completion.\nNote that because so few people took part in autumn and winter, this introduces a lot of uncertainty if we try and get at the effect holding season at its proportion, so we might be better off just providing the plot for Spring, as that is the most frequent season that people start the programme.\n\nlibrary(effects)\np1 &lt;- effect(c(\"selfmotZ\",\"season\"), compmod, xlevels=20) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  filter(season==\"spring\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=selfmotZ,y=fit))+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper),alpha=.2) +\n  labs(title=\"Predicted probability of\\ncouch-to-5k completion\",x=\"Self Motivation (Z-scored)\",y=\"P(Completed)\")\n\np2 &lt;- effect(c(\"accountabilityZ\",\"season\"), compmod, xlevels=20) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  filter(season==\"spring\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=accountabilityZ,y=fit))+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper),alpha=.2) +\n  labs(title=\"Predicted probability of\\ncouch-to-5k completion\",x=\"Accountability (Z-scored)\",y=\"P(Completed)\")\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting up\n\n\n\nSolution 17. Couch-to-5k completion (completed vs dropped out) was modelled using logistic regression, with the location (Glasgow, Edinburgh) and season in which participants undertake the programme as predictors, along with participants age, and their scores on two psychometric measures of accountability and self-motivation that were administered prior to participants starting the programme. A likelihood ratio test indicated that the inclusion of these two measures (accountability and self-motivation) collectively improves model fit over and above age, location and season (\\(\\chi^2(2) = 7.78, \\, p = 0.02\\)). All deviance residuals for the full model were less than 3 in magnitude.\nIn keeping with previous research, completion of the programme was found to differ between seasons, with participants undertaking the programme in both summer and autumn being associated with increased odds of programme completion (\\(OR: 35.73\\), \\(95\\% CI [10.89, 149.2]\\) and \\(37.23\\) \\([5.2, 792.8]\\) respectively). Age and city were not found to significantly predict completion.\nWhile completing the programme was not significantly associated with scores on the accountability measure, a relationship was found between self motivation and programme completion; a 1 standard deviation increase in self-motivation was associated with doubling the odds of finishing the entire 9-weeks (\\(OR: 2.08\\, [1.23, 3.7]\\)). The model-predicted probabilities of programme completion across values of the two psychometric measures are visualised in Figure 2. Full table of results can be found in Table 2\nThe present study indicated that the psychometric factors of accountability and self motivation, taken together, were useful in predicting the completion (vs drop out) of the couch-to-5k programme. Specifically, a strong association was found between self-motivation and programme completion, with more motivated participants have a higher probability of finishing the full 9 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Model estimated probability of completing the couch-to-5k programme across measures of accountability and self-motivation (both Z-scored), estimated for starting the programme in spring, and holding other predictors at their average/proportions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Couch-to-5k completion modeled using logistic regression.

Initially (week 5 exercises), Archer, Winther & Gandolfi (2024) investigated age differences in exploration of novel objects, and found that older monkeys spend on average less time playing with a novel object than their younger counterparts (we looked at this with both with the linear effect of age in years, and by comparing adults to juveniles). Following this, in our week 7 exercises Kennis, Lee, Zhou, Smith, Horner & Zhao (2025) wanted to see if monkeys showed a preference for different types of object (i.e. ones with moving parts vs ones that are soft). They found that, after accounting for differences due to age, monkeys showed a significant preference for toys with moving parts in comparison to soft toys.\nThe same team of researchers are again asking for our help, and this time with a bigger study, of 216 monkeys. They are interested in whether the preference for mechanical toys over soft toys is different for different species of monkey. Both the previous studies were conducted on Rhesus Macaques (a species that have adapted very well to human dominated landscapes), so this study has re-run the same experiment on 69 Capuchin monkeys, 71 Tamarin monkeys and 76 Macaques.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the following question:\n\nAre preferences between soft toys vs mechanical toys different for different species of monkey?\n\nThe data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/ctmtoys.csv and contains the variables described in Table 1\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Data dictionary for ctmtoys.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nMonkey Name\n\n\nage\nAge of monkey in years\n\n\nspecies\nSpecies (capuchin, macaque, tamarin)\n\n\nobj_type\nType of novel object given (mechanical / soft)\n\n\nobj_colour\nMain colour of object (red / green / blue)\n\n\nobj_size\nSize of object in cm (length of largest dimension of the object)\n\n\nexptime\nTime (in minutes) spent exploring the object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nAs always, begin by reading in your data and making some exploratory plots to get an idea of the distributions we’re dealing with.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 8.

The coefficient “speciestamarin” tells us the difference between tamarins and macaques, when obj_type is zero - i.e., when it is at the reference level (soft).\nSo we know that tamarins spend 1.9 more minutes with soft toys compared to macaques with soft toys:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution Part 4 - coefficient: obj_typemechanical:speciescapuchin\n\n\n\nSolution 17. The coefficient “obj_typemechanical:speciescapuchin” tells us the difference between capuchins and macaques’ soft-vs-mechanical differences.\ni.e. when moving from macaques to capuchins, the soft-to-mechanical difference changes by this much.\nSo we know that whereas macaques spend 3.5 more minutes with mechanical toys compared to soft toys, for capuchins this is 1.5 minutes less.\nSo rather than going up 3.5, we go up \\(3.5-1.5=2\\).\nHowever, this is non-significant. So the difference could easily just be 0 - i.e. they could increase by the same 3.5 minutes as Macaques do. So we know that the uncertainty here should also capture as if Capuchins and Macaques have the same increases from soft to mechanical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution Part 5 - coefficient: obj_typemechanical:speciestamarin\n\n\n\nSolution 18.

They want better understanding what makes teams work well together. Specifically, they want to know whether the amount of communication in a team is associated with better quality work, and if this is different depending upon the teams’ ‘collective efficacy’ (their belief in their ability to do the work)?\nThey have collected data on 80 teams. Prior to starting the projects, each team completed a questionnaire measuring ‘collective efficacy’ (the teams’ belief in their ability to succeed at their project), and ‘collective experience’ (a measure of how much relevant experience the team has). At the end of the projects, each team’s work was rated across various measures (timeliness, quality, relevance etc) to provide a metric of ‘work quality’. In addition, information was gathered on the volume of each teams’ communication (via the company’s workspace chat platform).\nThe data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/teamqual.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nteam_id\nTeam ID\n\n\ncommvol\nVolume of communication (avg messages per day)\n\n\nexp\nPrior experience (Z-scored)\n\n\ncolleff\nCollective Efficacy measure of team's belief in ability to succeed (range 0 - 70)\n\n\nwork_qual\nWork Quality measure (metric based on timeliness, quality, relevance etc).

Team experience (Z-scored), Communication volume (messages per day) and Collective efficacy (Z-scored) were included as predictors, along with the interaction between communication and collective efficacy. The model explained 80% of the variance in work-quality scores. More experienced teams were found to produce significantly better quality work (\\(\\beta=0.82, t(74)=0.4, p&gt;.05\\)). Volume of communication was significantly associated with work quality (\\(\\beta=2.68, t(75)=6.17, p&lt;.001\\)), suggesting that teams that communicate more produced better quality work. Collective efficacy was also significantly associated with work quality (\\(\\beta=1.59, t(75)=3.64, p&lt;.001\\)), indicating that better quality work will be produced by a team that has collective efficacy (compared to those that do not). A significant interaction (\\(\\beta=-0.03, t=2.68, p &lt; .09\\)) was found between volume of communication and collective efficacy, suggesting that these two predictors are related. Overall these results suggest that for teams that have more collective efficacy, communication is more important in producing quality work."

We’re going to want to use the binom.test() function. This is just like the reading, where we tested the proportion of our sample who were left-handed.\nWe can either type in the numbers of “Dog” people out of our total number:\n\nbinom.test(35, 77, p = 0.5, alternative = \"greater\")\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  35 and 77\nnumber of successes = 35, number of trials = 77, p-value = 0.819\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.3573548 1.0000000\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.4545455 \n\n\nOr give the function a table.\nBUT we need to make sure that it is picking up the right value as “successes”.\nNotice that this gives us a different result:\n\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  table(usmr25$catdog)\nnumber of successes = 42, number of trials = 77, p-value = 0.2472\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4455646 1.0000000\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.5454545 \n\n\nThis is because it is taking the first entry as the number of successes. So it is saying that Cat people = 1 and Dog people = 0. But we want it the other way around! You could either create a different table (or switch its order), or simply switch to the alternative being “less” (because in this unrealistic binary world, the question “is the probability of being Dog person &gt;0.5?” is the same thing as “is probability of being Cat person &lt;0.5?”)\n\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  table(usmr25$catdog)\nnumber of successes = 42, number of trials = 77, p-value = 0.819\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is less than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.0000000 0.6426452\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.5454545"

I sometimes like adding a |&gt; print() |&gt; in the middle of these sequences of pipes to print out the intermediary output as well:\n\ntable(usmr25$catdog) |&gt;\n  print() |&gt;\n  prop.table()\n\n\ncat dog \n 42  35 \n\n\n\n      cat       dog \n0.5454545 0.4545455 \n\n\nIf the probability was 50%, or 0.5, then we would expect the numbers to be equal. We have 77 responses here, so we would expect 38.5 to be team cats, and 38.5 to be team dogs!\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\n\nResearch Question: Is the probability that a student prefers Dogs over Cats greater than 50%?\n\nConduct a test to address the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the “tailedness” of the question. Just like t.test(), the function we use here should allow us to specify our hypothesis.\n\nYou can see an example of this test in Chapter 7 #binomials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 2. We’re going to want to use the binom.test() function. This is just like the reading, where we tested the proportion of our sample who were left-handed.\nWe can either type in the numbers of “Dog” people out of our total number:\n\nbinom.test(35, 77, p = 0.5, alternative = \"greater\")\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  35 and 77\nnumber of successes = 35, number of trials = 77, p-value = 0.819\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.3573548 1.0000000\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.4545455 \n\n\nOr give the function a table.\nBUT we need to make sure that it is picking up the right value as “successes”.\nNotice that this gives us a different result:\n\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  table(usmr25$catdog)\nnumber of successes = 42, number of trials = 77, p-value = 0.2472\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4455646 1.0000000\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.5454545 \n\n\nThis is because it is taking the first entry as the number of successes. So it is saying that Cat people = 1 and Dog people = 0. But we want it the other way around! You could either create a different table (or switch its order), or simply switch to the alternative being “less” (because in this unrealistic binary world, the question “is the probability of being Dog person &gt;0.5?” is the same thing as “is probability of being Cat person &lt;0.5?”)\n\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  table(usmr25$catdog)\nnumber of successes = 42, number of trials = 77, p-value = 0.819\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is less than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.0000000 0.6426452\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n             0.5454545"

    "text": "Jokes and Tips\n\nData: TipJokes\n\nResearch Question: Can telling a joke affect whether or not a waiter in a coffee bar receives a tip from a customer?\n\nA study published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology1 investigated this question at a coffee bar of a famous seaside resort on the west Atlantic coast of France. The waiter randomly assigned coffee-ordering customers to one of three groups. When receiving the bill, one group also received a card telling a joke, another group received a card containing an advertisement for a local restaurant, and a third group received no card at all.\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/TipJoke.csv\nThe dataset contains the variables:\n\nCard: None, Joke, Ad.\nTip: 1 = The customer left a tip, 0 = The customer did not leave tip.\n\n\n\nQuestion 11\n\n\nProduce a plot and a table to display the relationship between whether or not the customer left a tip, and what (if any) card they received alongside the bill.\nDon’t worry about making it all pretty.

    "text": "Optional Extras\n\nOptional Extra\n\n\nNote that the confidence interval from the previous question is concerned with describing the abstract and theoretical distribution of “what the mean sleep quality rating would look like from all possible samples of this size that I could take”. In order to do this we used a formula to describe the spread of this distribution, and in doing so had to assume that the standard deviation of our sample is a good approximation of the standard deviation of the population, and that the population is normally distributed.\nWe can also avoid ever using the standard deviation of our sample (sd(usmr2022on$sleeprating)), and instead approximate the sampling distribution of the mean by “bootstrapping” - taking repeated resamples with replacement from the original sample (see Chapter 4 #standard-error.\n\nbootstrap_means &lt;- replicate(1000, mean(sample(observed_sample, replace = TRUE)))\n\n\nCreate an object that contains the 10,000 means from 10,000 resamples of our sleep ratings.\n\nThe distribution of resample means is the ‘bootstrap distribution’. Plot a histogram of it. What is the standard deviation? How does it compare to the standard error you calculated in the previous question with the formula?\n\nAt what values does the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution fall?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 3, look up quantile(). We saw this in Chapter 4 #confidence-intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 14. \n\n\nResample means\nHere is our sample of sleep ratings:\n\nsleeprates &lt;- usmr2022on$sleeprating\n\nAnd we can get rid of the NA’s:\n\nsleeprates &lt;- sleeprates[!is.na(sleeprates)]\n\nWe can resample with replacement from this set of numbers by using the replace = TRUE argument in the sample() function.\nNote, we’re leaving size = blank, which means it will stop at the same length as the original vector we give it.\n\nsample(sleeprates, replace = TRUE)\n\nand the mean of a given resample is calculated by wrapping mean() around the above code:\n\nmean(sample(sleeprates, replace = TRUE))\n\n[1] 68.50698\n\n\nfinally, we’ll do it lots and lots of times, using replicate():\n\nBSmeans &lt;- replicate(10000, mean(sample(sleeprates, replace = TRUE)))\n\n\n\nBootstrap Distribution\nHere’s the histogram of the bootstrap distribution:\n\nhist(BSmeans)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s the standard deviation of that distribution. This is a bootstrapped estimate of the standard error.\n\nsd(BSmeans)\n\n[1] 1.501815\n\n\nRecall our standard error calculated using \\(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) from the previous question was 1.52\n\n\nPercentiles\nWe can get the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles (i.e. getting the middle 95%), using the code below. Recall our confidence intervals that we computed analytically were 63.38 and 69.34.\n\nquantile(BSmeans, c(.025,.975))\n\n    2.5%    97.5% \n63.43256 69.25581 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbootstraps\n\n\n\n\n\nBootstrapping is a great way to learn about sampling variability because it allows us to actually plot, summarise and describe what would otherwise be an abstract conceptual distribution.\nIt can also be a useful tool in practice, but it doesn’t come without its own problems/complexities. One important thing to note is that it often works worse than traditional methods for small samples, especially skewed samples (i.e. bootstrapping a “95% CI” for a small sample will often be too narrow and &lt;95%)."

    "text": "First things\nThe very first things to do are to open RStudio and get a blank script ready for writing your code!\n\n\nOur recommendation is that you have an R project for this course, and use a new script for each week of work. See the tip about “R projects” in Chapter 1.\n\n\nPet Data\n\nWe’re going to play with some data on a sample of licensed pets from the city of Seattle, USA. It can be downloaded (or read directly into R) from https://uoepsy.github.io/data/pets_seattle.csv. It contains information on the license ID, year of issue, as well as the species, breeds and weights of each pet. You can find a data dictionary in Table 1\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Seattle Pets: Data dictionary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nlicense_year\nYear in which license was issued\n\n\nlicense_number\nUnique license ID number\n\n\nanimals_name\nFull name of pet\n\n\nspecies\nSpecies of pet\n\n\nprimary_breed\nPrimary breed of pet\n\n\nsecondary_breed\nSecondary breed of pet\n\n\nweight_kg\nWeight in kilograms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nWrite a line of code that reads in the data to your R session. Then examine the dimensions of the dataset, and take a look at the first few lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll need the read.csv() function. Remember to assign it a name to store it in your environment.\nChapter 2 #basic-data-wrangling contains an example of reading in data from a URL. You’ll then want to play with functions like dim() and head().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 1. We’re going to call it petdata in our environment here. Don’t forget the quotation marks around the url (otherwise R will look for an object in your environment called https://..., which isn’t there).\n\npetdata&lt;-read.csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/pets_seattle.csv\")\ndim(petdata)\n\n[1] 1956    7\n\n\nWe can see there are 1956 rows and 7 columns.\nAnd we can see the first few rows here:\n\nhead(petdata)\n\n  license_year license_number  animals_name species         primary_breed\n1         2018      LNS150171        Norman     Dog                 Boxer\n2         2017        LN20666         Henry     Dog          Bichon Frise\n3         2018      LN8000658 Vega Williams     Dog                   Mix\n4         2018       LN730940         Molly     Dog   Australian Shepherd\n5         2016       LN964607         Gremy     Dog Chihuahua, Short Coat\n6         2018      LNS117115        Shadow     Dog   Retriever, Labrador\n  secondary_breed weight_kg\n1             Mix     29.15\n2        Havanese     23.70\n3         Unknown     21.13\n4             Mix     18.70\n5         Terrier     20.36\n6         Unknown     11.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nWhat are the names of the 47th and the 200th animals in the dataset?

There are lots of different ways to do this. We can get out the entire rows, either individually:\n\npetdata[47,]\npetdata[200,]\n\nOr together:\n\npetdata[c(47,200),]\n\n    license_year license_number animals_name species       primary_breed\n47          2018      LNS140233     Hooligan     Dog Retriever, Labrador\n200         2017       LN584186  Maple Syrup     Cat  Domestic Shorthair\n    secondary_breed weight_kg\n47          Unknown     12.27\n200         Unknown      4.66\n\n\nOr we can extract the names only:\n\n# These all do the same\npetdata[c(47,200),\"animals_name\"]\npetdata[c(47,200),3]\npetdata$animals_name[c(47,200)]\n\nThe will all give us these names:\n\n\n[1] \"Hooligan\"    \"Maple Syrup\"\n\n\nIn the last one, we use the $ to access the animals_name variable. In this case, we don’t need to specify [rows, columns] inside the square brackets, because it’s a single variable - there are no columns.\n\ndataframe[rows, columns]\n\nvariable[entries]\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nSubset the data to only the animals which are dogs, and store this subset as another named object in your environment.\nDo the same for the cats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll want to think about how we access data via asking for those entries that meet a specific condition (see Chapter 2 #accessing-by-a-condition)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 3. We can ask “which entries of species variable are equal to ‘Dog’?” by using pet$species==\"Dog\".\nThis will give us a TRUE for each dog, and a FALSE for each non-dog.\nWe can then use this set of TRUEs and FALSEs to access those rows for which it is TRUE in our data:\n\ndogdata &lt;- petdata[petdata$species==\"Dog\", ]\ncatdata &lt;- petdata[petdata$species==\"Cat\", ]\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nFind the name and weight of the heaviest cat, and of the lightest dog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could do this using the original data you read in from question 1, or use the subsets you created in question 3. You’ll again want to supply a condition within square brackets data[?==?]. That condition may well have something to do with being equal to the min() or the max() of some variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 4. We can use min() and max() to return the minimum and maximum of a variable:\n\nmin(dogdata$weight_kg)\n\n[1] 0.39\n\nmax(catdata$weight_kg)\n\n[1] 5.48\n\n\nWe could then ask for each entry “is this cat’s weight the maximum cat’s weight?” with catdata$weight_kg == max(catdata$weight_kg) and then use that condition to access the rows in our dataset where the weight_kg variable is at its maximum:\n\ncatdata[catdata$weight_kg == max(catdata$weight_kg), ]\n\n    license_year license_number animals_name species      primary_breed\n414         2018      LNS101014       Smokey     Cat Domestic Shorthair\n    secondary_breed weight_kg\n414             Mix      5.48\n\ndogdata[dogdata$weight_kg == min(dogdata$weight_kg), ]\n\n     license_year license_number animals_name species  primary_breed\n1126         2017      LNS139134       Claire     Dog Great Pyrenees\n     secondary_breed weight_kg\n1126         Unknown      0.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nDoes the original dataset contain only dogs and cats?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven what you did in question 3, you might be able to answer this by just looking at your environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 5. In the environment, we can see that the entire dataset has 1956 observations, the Dog’s data frame has 1322, and the Cat’s has 632.\nSo there are 2 missing!\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nExtract the entries of the original dataset for which the species is neither “Dog” nor “Cat”?\nWhat are the names and species of these animals?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a slightly complex one. Chapter 2 #more-complex-conditions might help you here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 6. As always, there are lots of different ways.\nHere are three:\n\n\n“not a dog AND not a cat”\nWe can ask if something is not a dog by using petdata$species != \"Dog\". But we want the rows where the species is not a dog and it’s not a cat. So it’s two conditions:\n\npetdata[petdata$species != \"Cat\" & petdata$species != \"Dog\", ]\n\n     license_year license_number     animals_name species primary_breed\n1505         2018      LNS147013    Billy the Kid    Goat     Miniature\n1655         2018      LNS132953 Vincent Van Goat    Goat     Miniature\n     secondary_breed weight_kg\n1505         Unknown    103.48\n1655         Unknown     73.96\n\n\n\n\n“not (dog OR cat)”\nWe could also do this in other ways, such as asking for all the entries which are either “Dog” or “Cat”, and then negating them:\n\npetdata[!(petdata$species == \"Cat\" | petdata$species == \"Dog\"), ]\n\n     license_year license_number     animals_name species primary_breed\n1505         2018      LNS147013    Billy the Kid    Goat     Miniature\n1655         2018      LNS132953 Vincent Van Goat    Goat     Miniature\n     secondary_breed weight_kg\n1505         Unknown    103.48\n1655         Unknown     73.96\n\n\n\n\n“not one of [Dog, Cat]”\nAnother clever little operator is the %in% operator, which asks whether something is in a set of things. Unfortunately, we can’t use !%in% to mean “not in”, so we need to put the ! right at the start of the condition:\n\npetdata[!petdata$species %in% c(\"Cat\",\"Dog\"), ]\n\n     license_year license_number     animals_name species primary_breed\n1505         2018      LNS147013    Billy the Kid    Goat     Miniature\n1655         2018      LNS132953 Vincent Van Goat    Goat     Miniature\n     secondary_breed weight_kg\n1505         Unknown    103.48\n1655         Unknown     73.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nCreate a new variable in the data, which contains the weights of all the animals, but rounded to the nearest kg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nTry looking up the help documentation for the function round(). Try playing with it in the console, e.g. round(c(3.5, 4.257, 1.1111)). You may find it helpful to look back at Chapter 2 #adding/changing-a-variable.\n\n“to the nearest kg” would mean we want no decimal points. Note that round() has a digits argument. e.g. round(22.324, digits = 2) and round(22.324, digits = 1) do different things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 7. We’re wanting this variable as a new column in the data, so don’t forget the dataframe$newvariable &lt;- ...... bit.\n\npetdata$weight_rounded &lt;- round(petdata$weight_kg)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\nTry giving the dataset to the function summary(). You’ll get out some information on each of the variables. It is likely that you’ll get more useful information for the variables containing information on the animal’s weights than for those containing their names, breeds etc because these variables are vectors of “characters”. We’ll start to look more about different types of data next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 8.

What it is actually doing, though, is defining a function called dice(). If you look at your environment panel (top right), you’ll see dice appear when you run the code.\nTo produce some output, we have to call the function dice() (by writing it into code: dice(4), for example). dice() wants to be supplied with some information (in the argument num). If no information is supplied, num will take a default value of 1. (So writing dice() is equivalent to writing dice(1)).\nWhat does dice() do with num? It calls another function, sample(), with 3 arguments. We didn’t write sample(): it’s a function that’s “supplied with” R. To find out more about what sample() does:\n\nclick inside the brackets just after sample() in your R script;\npress TAB (⇥), then F1\nyou should see some help appear in the bottom right-hand panel of RStudio.\n\nYou will find that “sample() takes a sample … from the elements of x …” If you compare the code in RStudio to the code under “Usage” you’ll see that where the help has x, we have 1:6. So what does 1:6 mean? One way to find out is to open the console in RStudio (bottom left) and just type stuff in. What happens when you type 1:6? What about 2:17? (What about 6:1?)\nRemember: The console is the place to “try stuff out” (don’t worry, you can’t break it).\nWhat you will discover is that 1:6 creates a vector (list of similar things, in this case numbers) of the numbers 1-6. The next bit of the sample() function is size. In the dice() function, the num passes down to the size of the sample(): Looking through the help, size is the number of items to choose. So sample(1:6, 1) would choose one number from the numbers 1-6 at random; sample(1:6, 3) would choose 3, and so on. The last argument, replace=TRUE, tells sample() what to do with a number once it’s been picked: Does it go ‘back into the bag’ to be picked again (TRUE) or not? (FALSE)?\nAround the outside is sum() which simply sums the numbers on however many (num) dice you “rolled”.\nPutting it all together, our dice() function “throws num dice” by sample()ing from the numbers 1-6 num times, replaceing each number when it’s been picked, and sums the numbers of all the dice.\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\nUse the function you just made to ‘roll a die’ a few times. Check that it works like you expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nYou just need to run dice() a few times. A single die means num = 1, which is the default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 9. \n\ndice()\n\n[1] 1\n\ndice()\n\n[1] 6\n\ndice()\n\n[1] 3\n\ndice()\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 11\n\n\nLook up the function replicate(). We can use it to do something in R lots of times! For instance, replicate(20, 1+1) will evaluate 1+1 twenty times.\nUse replicate() to simulate 20 rolls of a single die, and store the results in an object in your environment. Give it an easily identifiable name.\nWhat does each value in this object represent?\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 10. \n\nrolls20 &lt;- replicate(20, dice(num = 1))\nrolls20\n\n [1] 1 1 1 3 6 6 2 3 6 5 1 2 3 2 6 6 1 4 4 6\n\n\nEach value in rolls20 represents the simulated roll of a single die. We roll our die, and get a 1, we roll it again and get 1, the third roll we get 1, and so on..\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 12\n\n\nCreate a barplot showing the frequency with which each number was landed on in the 20 rolls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThe functions table() and barplot() were used to do this in the lecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 11. Your plots will look slightly different to these, because all of our dice are random!\n\n# We can get the frequency table using table()\ntable(rolls20)\n\nrolls20\n1 2 3 4 5 6 \n5 3 3 2 1 6 \n\n# Which we can then pass to the barplot() function:\nbarplot(table(rolls20))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 13\n\n\nDo the same for 100 rolls, and then for 1,000. What do you notice?\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 12. \n\nmorerolls &lt;- replicate(100, dice(1))\nbarplot(table(morerolls))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmorerolls2 &lt;- replicate(1000, dice(1))\nbarplot(table(morerolls2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more rolls we do of the dice, the flatter the graph becomes. This is because there is an equal probability of the die landing on any of the responses - there is a uniform probability.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 14\n\n\nCopy the code below into your script and run it. It creates a new function called wdice() which simulates the rolling of num dice which are slightly weighted.\nRoll a single weighted die 20 times and plot the frequency distribution. Do the same for 100 and 1,000 rolls of a single die. Does a pattern emerge? At how many rolls?\n\nwdice &lt;- function(num = 1){\n    sum(sample(1:6, num, replace=TRUE, prob = c(0.15,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.25)))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 13. \n\nwdice &lt;- function(num = 1){\n    sum(sample(1:6, num, replace=TRUE, prob = c(0.15,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.25)))\n}\n\nwd &lt;- replicate(20, wdice(1))\nbarplot(table(wd))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwd &lt;- replicate(1000, wdice(1))\nbarplot(table(wd))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwd &lt;- replicate(10000, wdice(1))\nbarplot(table(wd))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe die is clearly weighted towards landing on 6. However, is 20 rolls enough to reliably observe this? In our 20 rolls above, it landed on 3 quite a bit too (yours will be different)! The pattern becomes clearer after 1000 rolls.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 15\n\n\nRemember, wdice() and dice() are really just relying on different functions, like sample(). Try playing around with sample() in the console again - what does the prob = c(....) bit do?\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 14. The prob bit is defining the probabilities of observing each outcome - i.e. there is a 25% chance of rolling a 6.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 16\n\n\nLet’s try to modify the wdice() function. Edit the code for wdice() so that 50% of the time it lands on number 6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo test out your modified function, you will need to re-run the code which defines the function. When we use wdice() we use the function which is in our environment. If we want to edit the function, we need to then overwrite (or “replace”/“reassign”) the object in our environment.\n\nWe need to be careful to remember that the probability of different outcomes should sum to 1 (i.e., it’s not possible to “50% of the time land on 6” as well as “70% of the time land on 5”!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 15. \n\nwdice &lt;- function(num = 1){\n    sum(sample(1:6, num, replace=TRUE, prob = c(0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.5)))\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 17\n\n\nCan you observe the weighting in your new die (the one which 50% of the time lands on number 6) in only 20 rolls?\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 16. \n\nwd &lt;- replicate(20, wdice(1))\nbarplot(table(wd))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe die is very clearly weighted to land on 6. We can see this in just 20 rolls. Presumably it will become even clearer if we increased how many times we roll it.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 18\n\n\nConceptually, what can we learn from this toy example?\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 17. The more highly weighted a die is, the less we have to roll it in order to observe that weighting."

    "text": "Question 1\n\n\nAt the end of last week’s exercises, we estimated the mean sleep-quality rating, and computed a confidence interval, using the formula below.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{95\\% CI: }& \\bar x \\pm 1.96 \\times SE \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nCan you use R to show where the 1.96 comes from?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nqnorm! (see the end of Chapter 5 #uncertainty-due-to-sampling)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 1. The 1.96 comes from 95% of the normal distribution falling within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean:\n\nqnorm(c(0.025, 0.975))\n\n[1] -1.959964  1.959964\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nAs we learned in Chapter 6 #t-distributions, the sampling distribution of a statistic has heavier tails the smaller the size of the sample it is derived from. In practice, we are better using \\(t\\)-distributions to construct confidence intervals and perform statistical tests.\nThe code below creates a dataframe that contains the number of books read by 7 people in 2024.\n(Note tibble is just a tidyverse version of data.frame):\n\nbookdata &lt;- \n  tibble(\n    person = c(\"Martin\",\"Umberto\",\"Monica\",\"Emma\",\"Josiah\",\"Dan\",\"Aja\"),\n    books_read = c(12,19,9,11,8,28,13)\n  )\n\nCalculate the mean number of books read in 2024, and construct an appropriate 95% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 2. Here is our estimated average number of books read:\n\nmean(bookdata$books_read)\n\n[1] 14.28571\n\n\nAnd our standard error is still \\(\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\):\n\nsd(bookdata$books_read)/sqrt(nrow(bookdata))\n\n[1] 2.652171\n\n\nWith \\(n = 7\\) observations, and estimating 1 mean, we are left with \\(6\\) degrees of freedom.\nFor our 95% confidence interval, the \\(t^*\\) in the formula below is obtained via:1\n\nqt(0.975, df = 6)\n\n[1] 2.446912\n\n\nOur confidence interval is therefore:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{CI} &= \\bar{x} \\pm t^* \\times SE \\\\\n\\text{95\\% CI} &= 14.286 \\pm 2.447 \\times 2.652 \\\\\n\\text{95\\% CI} &= [7.80,\\, 20.78] \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nWill a 90% confidence interval be wider or narrow?\nCalculate it and see.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 3. A 90% confidence interval will be narrower:\n\nqt(0.95, df = 6)\n\n[1] 1.94318\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{CI} &= \\bar{x} \\pm t^* \\times SE \\\\\n\\text{90\\% CI} &= 14.286 \\pm 1.943 \\times 2.652 \\\\\n\\text{90\\% CI} &= [9.13,\\, 19.44] \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe intuition behind this is that our level of confidence is inversely related to the width of the interval.\nTake it to the extremes:\n\nI have 100% confidence that the interval \\([-Infinity, +Infinity]\\) contains the true population mean.\nIf I want an narrower interval, then I have to sacrifice confidence. e.g. a 10% CI: \\([13.94, 14.63]\\)\n\nImagine playing a game of ringtoss. A person throwing a 2-meter diameter hoop will have much more confidence that they are going to get it over the pole than a person throwing a 10cm diameter ring."

An overall score of daytime functioning can be calculated by:\n\nreversing the scores for items 4,5 and 6 (because those items reflect agreement with positive statements, whereas the other ones are agreement with negative statement);\nsumming the scores on each item; and\nsubtracting the sum score from 50 (the max possible score). This will make higher scores reflect better perceived daytime functioning.\n\nThe data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/sleepdtf.csv\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Daytime Functioning Questionnaire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nStatement\n\n\n\n\nItem_1\nI often felt an inability to concentrate\n\n\nItem_2\nI frequently forgot things\n\n\nItem_3\nI found thinking clearly required a lot of effort\n\n\nItem_4\nI often felt happy\n\n\nItem_5\nI had lots of energy\n\n\nItem_6\nI worked efficiently\n\n\nItem_7\nI often felt irritable\n\n\nItem_8\nI often felt stressed\n\n\nItem_9\nI often felt sleepy\n\n\nItem_10\nI often felt fatigued\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nLoad the required libraries (probably just tidyverse for now), and read in the data.\nCalculate the overall daytime functioning score, following the criteria outlined above, and make this a new column in your dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reverse items 4, 5 and 6, we we need to make all the scores of 1 become 5, scores of 2 become 4, and so on… What number satisfies all of these equations: ? - 5 = 1, ? - 4 = 2, ? - 3 = 3?\nTo quickly sum across rows, you might find the rowSums() function useful (you don’t have to use it though)\nIf my items were in columns between 4 to 15:\n\ndataframe$sumscore = rowSums(dataframe[, 4:15])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution Part 1 - Reversing Items\n\n\n\nSolution 1. \n\nsleepdtf &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/sleepdtf.csv\")\nsummary(sleepdtf)\n\n      TST             item_1         item_2         item_3         item_4    \n Min.   : 4.900   Min.   :1.00   Min.   :1.00   Min.   :1.00   Min.   :1.00  \n 1st Qu.: 7.225   1st Qu.:1.00   1st Qu.:2.00   1st Qu.:1.25   1st Qu.:1.00  \n Median : 7.900   Median :1.00   Median :2.00   Median :2.00   Median :1.00  \n Mean   : 8.004   Mean   :1.58   Mean   :2.46   Mean   :2.38   Mean   :1.26  \n 3rd Qu.: 9.025   3rd Qu.:2.00   3rd Qu.:3.00   3rd Qu.:3.00   3rd Qu.:1.00  \n Max.   :11.200   Max.   :3.00   Max.   :5.00   Max.   :5.00   Max.   :3.00  \n     item_5         item_6         item_7         item_8        item_9    \n Min.   :1.00   Min.   :1.00   Min.   :1.00   Min.   :1.0   Min.   :1.00  \n 1st Qu.:2.00   1st Qu.:2.00   1st Qu.:1.00   1st Qu.:2.0   1st Qu.:2.00  \n Median :2.00   Median :3.00   Median :2.00   Median :2.5   Median :3.00  \n Mean   :2.36   Mean   :2.78   Mean   :2.04   Mean   :2.5   Mean   :2.96  \n 3rd Qu.:3.00   3rd Qu.:4.00   3rd Qu.:3.00   3rd Qu.:3.0   3rd Qu.:4.00  \n Max.   :4.00   Max.   :5.00   Max.   :4.00   Max.   :4.0   Max.   :5.00  \n    item_10    \n Min.   :1.00  \n 1st Qu.:2.00  \n Median :3.00  \n Mean   :2.54  \n 3rd Qu.:3.00  \n Max.   :5.00  \n\n\nTo reverse the items, we can simply do 6 minus the score:\n\nsleepdtf &lt;- \n  sleepdtf |&gt; mutate(\n    item_4=6-item_4,\n    item_5=6-item_5,\n    item_6=6-item_6\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution Part 2 - Creating a scale score\n\n\n\nSolution 2.

    "text": "Monkey Exploration\n\nData: monkeyexplorers.csv\nArcher, Winther & Gandolfi (2024)1 have conducted a study on monkeys! They were interested in whether younger monkeys tend to be more inquisitive about new things than older monkeys do. They sampled 108 monkeys ranging from 1 to 24 years old. Each monkey was given a novel object, the researchers recorded the time (in minutes) that each monkey spent exploring the object.\nFor this week, we’re going to be investigating the research question:\n\nDo older monkeys spend more/less time exploring novel objects?\n\nThe data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/monkeyexplorers.csv and contains the variables described in Table 3\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Data dictionary for monkeyexplorers.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nMonkey Name\n\n\nage\nAge of monkey in years\n\n\nexploration_time\nTime (in minutes) spent exploring the object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nFor this week, we’re going to be investigating the following research question:\n\nDo older monkeys spend more/less time exploring novel objects?\n\nRead in the data to your R session, then visualise and describe the marginal distributions of those variables which are of interest to us. These are the distribution of each variable (time spent exploring, and monkey age) without reference to the values of the other variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could use, for example, geom_density() for a density plot or geom_histogram() for a histogram.\nLook at the shape, center and spread of the distribution. Is it symmetric or skewed? Is it unimodal or bimodal?\nDo you notice any extreme observations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 5. \n\nmonkeyexp &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/monkeyexplorers.csv\")\nhead(monkeyexp)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  name            age exploration_time\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Ed Sheeran        8             13.1\n2 Vince Gill       17              6.8\n3 Jewel            13             12.8\n4 Jaden Smith      18              8.9\n5 Reba McEntire    16              1.1\n6 Metallica        13              5.7\n\n\nWe can plot the marginal distribution of these two continuous variables as density curves, and add a boxplot underneath to check for the presence of outliers. The width of the geom_boxplot() is always quite wide, so I want to make it narrower so that we can see it at the same time as the density plot. Deciding on the exact value for the width here is just trial and error:\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n# the patchwork library allows us to combine plots together\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = age)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 1/300) +\n  labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", \n       y = \"Probability density\") +\n\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = exploration_time)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 1/175) +\n  labs(x = \"Time spent exploring a\\n novel object (in minutes)\", \n       y = \"Probability density\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Density plot and boxplot of monkey’s age and their time spent exploring novel objects\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots suggests that the distributions of monkeys’ ages and the time they spend exploring novel objects are both unimodal. Most of the monkeys are between roughly 8 and 18 years old, and most of them spent between 7 and 12 minutes exploring the objects. The boxplots suggest an outlier in the distribution of exploration-times, with one monkeys spending more than \\(1.5 \\times IQR\\) beyond the 3rd quartile.\nTo further summarize a distribution, it is typical to compute and report numerical summary statistics such as the mean and standard deviation.\nAs we have seen, in earlier weeks, one way to compute these values is to use the summarise()/summarize() function from the tidyverse library:\n\nmonkeyexp |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    mean_age = mean(age), \n    sd_age = sd(age),\n    mean_exptime = mean(exploration_time),\n    sd_exptime = sd(exploration_time)\n    )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  mean_age sd_age mean_exptime sd_exptime\n     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     13.5   5.92         9.40       4.50\n\n\n\nThe marginal distribution of age is unimodal with a mean of 13.5 years, and a standard deviation of 5.9.\nThe marginal distribution of time-spent-exploring is unimodal with a mean of 9.4 years, and a standard deviation of 4.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nAfter we’ve looked at the marginal distributions of the variables of interest in the analysis, we typically move on to examining relationships between the variables.\nVisualise and describe the relationship between age and exploration-time among the monkeys in the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nDirection of association\nForm of association (can it be summarised well with a straight line?)\n\nStrength of association (how closely do points fall to a recognizable pattern such as a line?)\nUnusual observations that do not fit the pattern of the rest of the observations and which are worth examining in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 6. Because we are investigating how time-spent-exploring varies with monkeys’ ages, the exploration-time here is the dependent variable (on the y-axis), and age is the independent variable (on the x-axis).\n\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = age, y = exploration_time)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", \n       y = \"Time spent exploring a\\n novel object (in minutes)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The relationship between monkeys’ age and time-spent-exploring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a moderate negative linear relationship between age and exploration time in these monkeys. Older monkeys appear to spend less time, on average, exploring a novel object. The scatterplot does highlight that there is one one young monkey who is behaving a bit weirdly, and spent quite a long time exploring the object!\nTo comment numerically on the strength of the linear association we might compute the correlation coefficient that we were introduced to in Chapter 9: Covariance & Correlation\n\nmonkeyexp |&gt;\n  select(age, exploration_time) |&gt;\n  cor()\n\n                        age exploration_time\nage               1.0000000       -0.2885495\nexploration_time -0.2885495        1.0000000\n\n\nthat is, \\(r_{\\text{age, exploration-time}} = -0.29\\)\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\nUsing the lm() function, fit a linear model to the sample data, in which time that monkeys spend exploring novel objects is explained by age.

Check Chapter 10 #example, which shows an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 10. \n\nggplot(data = monkeyexp, aes(x = age, y = exploration_time)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm) +\n  labs(x = \"Age (in years)\", \n       y = \"Time spent exploring a\\n novel object (in minutes)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 12 - Optional\n\n\nConsider the following:\n\nIn fitting a linear regression model, we make the assumption that the errors around the line are normally distributed around zero (this is the \\(\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma)\\) bit.)\n\nAbout 95% of values from a normal distribution fall within two standard deviations of the centre.\n\nWe can obtain the estimated standard deviation of the errors (\\(\\hat \\sigma\\)) from the fitted model using sigma() and giving it the name of our model.\nWhat does this tell us?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Chapter 10 #the-error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 11. The estimated standard deviation of the errors can be obtained by:\n\nsigma(model1)\n\n[1] 4.324399\n\n\nFor any particular age, the time monkeys spend exploring novel objects is estimated as being distributed above and below the regression line with a standard deviation of \\(\\hat \\sigma = 4.32\\). Since \\(1.96 \\hat \\sigma = 1.96 \\times 4.32 = \\text{approx} 8.6\\), we would expect most (about 95%) of the monkeys’ exploration times to be within about 8.6 minutes from the regression line.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 13 - Optional\n\n\nCompute the model-predicted exploration-time for a monkey that is 1 year old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that you know the intercept and slope, you can calculate this algebraically. However, try to also use the predict() function (see Chapter 10 #model-predictions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 12. Using predict(), we need to give it our model, plus some new data which contains a monkey that has 1 in the age column. First we make a new dataframe with an age variable, with one entry which has the value 1, and then we give that to predict():\n\nage_query &lt;- data.frame(age = c(1))\npredict(model1, newdata = age_query)\n\n       1 \n12.14356 \n\n\nGiven that our fitted model takes the form:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\text{ExplorationTime}} = 12.36 - 0.22 \\cdot \\text{Age}\n\\]\nWe are asking what the predicted exploration time is for a monkey with 1 year of age. So we can substitute in “1” for the Age variable: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{ExplorationTime} &= 12.36 - 0.22 \\cdot \\text{Age} \\\\\n\\text{ExplorationTime} &= 12.36 - 0.22 \\cdot 1 \\\\\n\\text{ExplorationTime} &= 12.36 - 0.22\\\\\n\\text{ExplorationTime} &= 12.14\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfluential Monkeys\n\nQuestion 14\n\n\nTake a look at the assumption plots (see Chapter 10 #assumptions) for your model.\n\nThe trick to looking at assumption plots in linear regression is to look for “things that don’t look random”.\nAs well as looking for patterns, these plots can also higlight individual datapoints that might be skewing the results. Can you figure out if there are any unusual monkeys in our dataset? Can you re-fit the model without that monkey? When you do so, do your conclusions change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 13. \n\nplot(model1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these plots, we can see that the 57th observation is looking a bit influential. It is the one datapoint that is looking weird in all of the plots.\nLet’s look at them:\n\nmonkeyexp[57, ]\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  name       age exploration_time\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Lil Fizz     5             33.1\n\n\nThis is a young monkey (5 years old) called “Lil Fizz”, who seems to have spent quite a long time exploring the toy. It’s important to remember that this monkey is a valuable datapoint, despite being a bit different from the general pattern.\nHowever, it would be nice to know how much Lil Fizz is affecting our conclusions, so let’s re-fit the model on everybody except that one monkey\n\nmodel1a &lt;- lm(exploration_time ~ age, data = monkeyexp[-57, ])\nsummary(model1a)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = exploration_time ~ age, data = monkeyexp[-57, ])\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-10.558  -2.321   0.427   2.386   9.884 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Do we continue with the monkey removed, or do we keep them in? There’s not really a right answer here, but it’s worth noting a practical issue - our assumption plots look considerably better for our model without this monkey.\nWhatever we do, when writing up the analysis we need to mention clearly if and why we exclude any observations, and how that decision has/hasn’t influenced our conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonkey Exploration in Adulthood\nLet’s suppose instead of having measured monkeys’ ages in years, researchers simply recorded whether each monkey was an adult or a juvenile (species like Capuchins and Rhesus Macaques reach adulthood at about 8 years old).\nThe code below creates a this new variable for us:\n\nmonkeyexp &lt;- monkeyexp |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    isAdult = ifelse(age &gt;= 8, \"yes\",\"no\")\n  )\n\n\nQuestion 15\n\n\nFit the following model, and interpret the coefficients.\n\\[\n\\text{ExplorationTime} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot \\text{isAdult} + \\varepsilon\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nFor help interpreting the coefficients, see Chapter 10 #binary-predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 14. \n\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(exploration_time ~ 1 + isAdult, data = monkeyexp)\nsummary(model2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = exploration_time ~ 1 + isAdult, data = monkeyexp)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-11.2556  -2.3694  -0.0444   2.5556  21.4444 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Participation involved reading a short article about some research in neuroscience, and then rating how credible they found the research. Participants were randomly placed into one of three conditions, in which the article was presented a) in text alone, b) with a picture of a brain, or c) with a picture of a brain and a fancy looking (but unrelated to the research) graph.
