# Key Points
+ Binomial Tests

+ `\(\chi^2\)` Distribution

+ `\(\chi^2\)` Tests
  + Goodness of Fit
  + Test of Independence

---
# More Tests

+ The *t*-test &amp; *z*-test are useful in certain situations

--

+ These tests are used to:

--
 
  + Compare *continuous* data from two groups
  
      + Independent groups (independent-samples t-tests)
      + Dependent groups (paired-samples t-tests)

--
    + Compare *continuous* data to a known value
    
      + A known `\(\mu\)` and `\(\sigma\)`(z-test)
      + A known `\(\mu\)` when `\(\sigma\)` is unknown (one-sample t-test)


--

+ However, there are times you’ll want to conduct a statistical analysis on data that fall outside these parameters

???
You use your data to compute a test statistic, and then you calculate the probability of observing a statistic at least as extreme as yours, given that the null hypothesis is true

---
# More Tests

+ Suppose you want to test data that are not continuous...
+ In this case, you're probably interested in whether your data are distributed in the way you would expect

  + Are cat and dog lovers evenly distributed in this course?
  + Does opinion of the monarchy (approve/disapprove) differ across political parties?
  + Do people who vape develop lung disease in similar frequencies to those who smoke?
  
--

+ To do this, you can use tests that are specifically meant to compare frequencies of the categories within your data: 
  + Binomial Tests
  + Chi-Square ( `\(\chi^2\)` ) Tests

# Part 1: Binomial Tests

# Binomial tests
+ **Binomial distribution:** probability distribution where just two possible outcomes have fixed probabilities

--

+ The probability of the two outcomes does not necessarily have to be equal, but must sum to one
  
--

+ The binomial distribution can be used to describe the counts of a variable that has two outcomes and an expectation of a specific proportion between the two 

--

+ The binomial distribution describes data that follow these conditions:
  + The number of trials or observations (*n*) is fixed
  + Each observation is independent
  + Each observation has one of two outcomes
  + The probability of each outcome is consistent across observations

# The `\(\chi^2\)` distribution
+ Sometimes you need to test the frequencies of variables that have more than 2 levels

--

+ Similar to previous tests with continuous variables, a test statistic is computed and compared to a cutoff within a larger distribution

--

  + Like the *t*-distribution, the comparison distribution is dependent upon the degrees of freedom

  + Unlike the *t*-distribution, the degrees of freedom isn't dependent on sample size, but on the number of comparison groups

# `\(\chi^2\)` - Goodness of Fit

Let's imagine that Semmelweis spent some time gathering data on daily mortality rates:


```
##         Day weekMR

## 2   Tuesday     31

## 5    Friday     29
## 6  Saturday     32
## 7    Sunday     44

If there was absolutely no difference in mortality rates across days of the week, we would expect the values for each day to be equal.

# How did it end for Semmelweis?

+ He noticed that a major difference in the two settings was that the doctors and residents were doing a lot of autopsies...

--

+ AND NOT WASHING THEIR HANDS OR INSTRUMENTS

--

+ Semmelweis was a handwashing pioneer - he recommended that doctors use a chlorine solution to cleanse their hands and instruments.

+ So it was a great victory for Semmelweis, right?

--
+ No.

--
 
+ "He too was attacked widely by the establishment of obstetricians in Europe, who could not believe that they or their midwife colleagues were responsible for the enormous number of deaths." (Chamberlain, 2006)
