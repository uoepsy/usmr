# So: Is Casper Special?

- How surprised should we be that Casper is 198 cm tall?

- Given the population he's in, the probability that he's 28cm or more taller than the mean of 170 is `r (pp=pnorm(198,170,12,lower.tail=FALSE))` 
  + (Keep in mind, this is according to a _one-tailed hypothesis_)
  
--

- A more accurate way of saying this is that `r pp` is the probability of selecting him (or someone even taller than him) from the population at random
  + There is about a 1% chance of selecting someone Casper's size or taller from the population. 

---
# A Judgement Call
```{r, echo = F}
pp=pnorm(198,170,12,lower.tail=FALSE)

We have to decide:

--

.pull-left[
.center[
If a `r (pc=round(100*pp,0))`% probability is _small enough_
]
.center[
```{r, out.width='55%', echo = FALSE}

]]
???
If a `r pc`% probability of selecting someone 28cm or more above the mean is enough to surprise us, then we should be surprised

If, on the other hand, we think `r pc`% isn't particularly low, then we shouldn't be surprised
--

.pull-right[
.center[
If a `r pc`% chance doesn't impress us much
.center[
```{r, out.width = '55%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('lecture_3_files/img/playmo_bad.jpg')
```
]]
]

--

Note that, in either case, we have nothing (mathematical) to say about the _reasons_ for Casper's height

???
when it comes to comparing means, we'll see that there are conventions for the criteria we use, but they are just that:  conventions, because this is a judgement call.

And importantly, none of the maths we have done will tell us anything about the _reasons_ for Casper's height&mdash;that's for us to reason about.

Perhaps he's so tall because he's weightless, or perhaps he had a lot of milk in his diet:  That's the substance of the scientific paper we're going to write:  The statistical calculation just tells us that he's mildly unusual.

In the next part, we're going to look at how this works for group means as opposed to individuals, but the TL;DR is:  pretty much the same.

Is this a one-tailed or two-tailed hypothesis? What would the two-tailed version be?

Why is that the question that we care about? And what does it mean to come from the same population? To understand that, we need to go back to idea of the normal distribution we talked about last week.

]

???
Let's take a guess that hours of sleep is a normally distributed variable in the population with a mean of around 8. So let's look at a density plot of this variable (remember, this shows the frequency of each value of the variable, or how often that value is measured). 

If hours of sleep is a normally distributed variable, it means that the hours of sleep most people need falls right around the mean, with some people needing fewer hours and some people needing more. 

What do we mean when we say same population? 

In general, we mean a collection of individuals who have similar characteristics. 

For the purpose of this example, our population will refer to adults with typical sleep needs.

For example the sleep recommendation of around 8 hours is for those 18 years and older. So in this case, children aren't part of our population. 

Someone with a sleep disorder is also not part of our population.

The null distribution is the probability distribution of the scores when the null hypothesis is accurate.

But what if the null hypothesis isn't accurate? What if the reason we see differences in the two means is because there are systematic differences in our group that affect their sleep?

If that were truly the case, the distribution of the scores that we measured may support our alternative hypothesis. So let's map those.

+ From this, it _looks_ as though our students may be getting less sleep than they should.

+ However, simply seeing a shift in the curves isn't enough evidence to make that claim with certainty.

# The $t$ Distribution

+ Conceptually, the $t$ distribution increases uncertainty when the sample is small

  + The probability of more extreme values is slightly higher
  
+ Exact shape of distribution depends on sample size


```{r ts, echo=F, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3.25}
df <- tibble(x=c(0,3.5))
df %>% ggplot(aes(x=x)) +
  stat_function(fun=dt,n=151,args=list(df=11),colour="red") +
  stat_function(fun=dt,n=151,args=list(df=5),colour = baseColor) +
  stat_function(fun=dt,n=151,args=list(df=23),colour="black") +
  xlab("Standard Deviations") + ylab("Density") +
  annotate(geom="text",x=1.7,y=.3,label="t(11)",colour="red",size=6) +
  annotate(geom="text",x=1.7,y=.34,label="t(23)",colour="black",size=6) +
  annotate(geom="text",x=1.7,y=.26,label="t(5)",colour=baseColor,size=6) +

here, I'= only showing the right-hand side of each distribution, so that you can see the differences between different degrees of freedom

the distributions are, of course, symmetrical

# Using the t Distribution

- In part 2, we calculated the mean hours of sleep for the group as `r sl` 

- We used the formula $z=\frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ to calculate $z$, and the standard normal curve to calculate probability

--

- **The formula for a one-sample $t$-test is the same as the formula for $z$ **

  + What differs is the _distribution we are using to calculate probability_
  
  + We need to know the degrees of freedom (to get the right $t$-curve)
  
- so $t(\textrm{df}) = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$

# Types of Hypothesis

```{r, eval=FALSE}
t.test(m$sleep, mu=0, alternative = "less")
```

+ Note the use of `alternative="less"`

+ This refers to the direction of our **alternative hypothesis, $H_{1}$**
  + $H_{1}$ is that our students would be getting _less_ sleep than the average person.
  
+ Can also have `alternative="greater"`...

--

  + Our students are getting _more_ sleep than the average person

--

+ ...And `alternative="two.sided"`

--
  + Our students are getting _different_ amounts of sleep than the average person

# Putting it Together

For $t(11)=`r (sl-8)/se`$, $p =`r pt((sl-8)/se, 11,lower.tail=TRUE)`$:

.br3.pa2.pt2.bg-gray.white.f4[
If you picked 12 people at random from a population of people who get the recommended number of hours of sleep, there would be a `r (pc=round(100*pt((sl-8)/se, 11,lower.tail=T),0))`% chance that their average sleep would be `r round(mean(m$sleep), 2)` hours or less
]

.pt2[
- Is `r pc`% low enough for you to believe that the mean sleep probably wasn't due to chance?

- Perhaps we'd better face up to this question!

# Making a Decision 

+ To make this decision, we use a cut-off value for $p$ called $\alpha$ 

--

+ $\alpha$ is the probability of rejecting ${H_{0}}$ when it actually reflects the ground truth

--

  + If $p$ is less than $\alpha$, we can decide to _reject H<sub>0</sub>_ and _accept H<sub>1</sub>_

  + If $p$ is greater than $\alpha$, we _fail to reject H<sub>0</sub>_ 

--

+ Typically, in Psychology, ** $\alpha$ is set to .05**
  + We're willing to take a 5% risk of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. 

--
  
+ It's important to set $\alpha$ _before_ any statistical analysis

I've shown you here on the normal curve because it's a more general distribution than the $t$ distribution, which requires degrees of freedom, but the graphs would look quite similar, as you know

- if we're testing a medicine, with possible side-effects, we want alpha to be low

- for general psychology, meh...

- no leading zeroes because $p$ is always less than 1

- no cheating now!fl

# $p < .05$

- The $p$-value is the probability of finding our results under H<sub>0</sub>, the null hypothesis

- H<sub>0</sub> is essentially "&#128169; happens"
  
- $\alpha$ is the maximum level of $p$ at which we are prepared to conclude that H<sub>0</sub> is false (and argue for H<sub>1</sub>)

--

.flash.animated[
## there is a 5% probability of falsely rejecting H<sub>0</sub>
]

- Wrongly rejecting H<sub>0</sub> (false positive) is a **type 1 error**

- Wrongly failing to reject H<sub>0</sub> (false negative) is a **type 2 error**

# Types of t-tests

+ All $t$-tests compare two means, but with different group constraints

--

+ **One-sample $t$-test**

--

  + Compares the mean from a range of scores to a specific value
  
--
  
  + Lets you examine whether the mean of your data is significantly different from a set value
  
--
  
+ **Independent-samples $t$-test**

--

  + Compares the means of two independent groups
  
--
  
  + Lets you examine whether two groups differ significantly from each other on the variable of interest

--

+ **Paired-samples $t$-test**

--

  + Compares means that are paired in some way
  
--
  
  + Allows you to compare measures that come from the same individual, e.g.
