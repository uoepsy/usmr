# So: Is Casper Special?

- how surprised should we be that Casper is 198 cm tall?

- given the population he's in, the probability that he's 28cm or more taller than the mean of 170 is `r (pp=pnorm(198,170,12,lower.tail=FALSE))`

- in either case, we have nothing (mathematical) to say about the _reasons_ for Casper's height

???
when it comes to comparing means, we'll see that there are conventions for the criteria we use, but they are just that:  conventions, because this is a judgement call.

And importantly, none of the maths we have done will tell us anything about the _reasons_ for Casper's height&mdash;that's for us to reason about.

Perhaps he's so tall because he's weightless, or perhaps he had a lot of milk in his diet:  That's the substance of the scientific paper we're going to write:  The statistical calculation just tells us that he's mildly unusual.

In the next part, we're going to look at how this works for group means as opposed to individuals, but the TL;DR is:  pretty much the same.
