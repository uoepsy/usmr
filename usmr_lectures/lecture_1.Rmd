- it can include R code like `r knitr::inline_expr("sqrt(2)")`
- it's simple to format things like bulleted lists

R is a multipurpose programming language with an emphasis on statistics.

It can do all of the things that any statistics package can do and much more:

Here, we're using it to visualise the frequencies with which words are used
in Jane Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_.

# Why Use R?

.pt4[
- because it's a _language_, I can easily show you what I did and you can copy it

- because it's a _language_, statisticians can use it to implement leading-edge stats

- because it's _free_, anyone can use it---and anyone can access your research

- because it's _open source_, anyone can fix or improve `R`

## Getting to Grips with R

# Data in R

- you can type **data** directly in to R
```{r d1}
# a number
1.2
# characters (a string)
"fáilte"
```

- and you can do **operations** on data

```{r d2}
1.2 + 7 * 2
```

by "data" we really mean anything that is measured *outside* R and provided to R directly

# Variables

]
.right-column[
- you can assign data to **variables**
```{r d3}

- and use those variables
```{r d4}
bodyTemp * (9/5) + 32 # to Fahrenheit
```
- **NB** spelling/capitalization matter

BodyTemp - 37

- note that I've made _hair_ a factor but left _names_ as character strings.

- that's because, in my world, there is a finite set of hair colours, but a name can be anything:  it's an arbitrary label.

- you'll see the effect of this in the next slide.

# Can you run an **function** on a **dataframe**?

- youbetcha!

```{r df2}
summary(people)
```

- or on a vector
```{r db}
mean(people$temp) # just the temp column from people
```
???
note the difference between the name column ("there are some strings") and the hair column ("I know there are categories:  this is how many of each you have")

- $\frac{1}{36}$ chance of throwing two sixes

## create some dice

???
- show creating a project

- markdown; call project **dice**

- first show `1:6`

- then `sample(1:6, 1)`

- then help for `sample()`

- then `sample(1:6, 2, replace=T)`

- then `sum(sample(1:6,2,replace=T))`

- then make a `dice(num=1)` function which returns the sum, for default 1
---

```{r dice}
dice <- function(num=1) {
  sum(sample(1:6, num, replace=TRUE))

replicate(250,dice(2))
