## [A Theory about the Structure of Chance]{.r-fit-text}

- if we deviate _enough_ from that structure, we assume that something else is at play

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-asp: .8
x <- tibble(x=c(-4,4))
x %>% ggplot(aes(x=x)) +
  stat_function(fun=dnorm,linewidth=1.5) +
  xlab("variable") + ylab("density") +
  ggtitle("Chance")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=NULL)

db <- function(x) {dnorm(x-2)+dnorm(x+1)}
x %>% ggplot(aes(x=x)) +
  stat_function(fun=db,linewidth=1.5) +
  xlab("variable") + ylab("density") +
  ggtitle("Something Else?") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=NULL)

```

## What is Enough?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](img/playmo_frazzled.jpg){width="80%" fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

- _enough_ is operationalised as a probability

  - based on summary statistics (e.g., $\bar{x}, \sigma, n, \textrm{se}$)
  
- summaries _assume that chance is ruling things_

- summary statistics are often

  - $\frac{x-\bar{x}}{\sigma}$ (single observations)
  - $\frac{\bar{x}}{\textrm{se}}$ (group summaries)
  
- (these are basically the same thing, compared to $z$ or $t$ as appropriate)
:::
::::

---

::: myblock
if the probability of obtaining the data we have observed (or more extreme data) under the null hypothesis is low enough...
:::

[if]{.red}

- we have made the right assumptions about chance

- we have calculated the right summary

- we have looked up the appropriate probability (of obtaining summary statistic or more)

- that probability is below the $\alpha$ level we have previously set

[then]{.red}

- we can, tentatively, suggest that maybe the pattern we have observed is not due to chance

## But Linear Models...?

::: myyellowblock
$$\color{red}{\textrm{outcome}_i} = \color{blue}{(\textrm{model})_i} + \textrm{error}_i$$
:::

- essentially, these are based on _covariance_

- the [_model_]{.blue} expresses the amount that variables covary

- the _error_ is the unexplained variance, and we have a theory about its distribution

- we want the _model_ (SS) to be big compared to the _error_ (SS)

  - the $F$ ratio measures this (so does $R^2$, less directly)
  
- again, we're calculating summary statistics and looking up the probability of obtaining them (or more) in a chance universe

## Coefficients

- coefficients tell you about (hypothetical) lines through data

- the most important (and often least exciting) coefficient is the _intercept_

  - other properties of the line are always relative to this

  - we can change the interpretation of the intercept by _scaling_ predictors

::: fragment

### when predictors are _categories_

- we assign numbers to the category values (one pair of values for each of $n-1$ comparisons)

  - the interpretation of the intercept depends on these values
  
:::

## Non-Linear Outcomes

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](img/playmo_pirate_ghost.jpg){width="80%" fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- use **generalized linear models**

- specify **link function**

- most frequent case is _binomial_

  → **logit** (log-odds) link function

`lm (y ~ x)` and `lm (x ~ y)` are "the same" (`cor.test(y,x)`)

# [The Bits We Didn't Talk About]{.r-fit-text style="text-align: center;"}

## ANOVA 

> If you should say to a mathematical statistician that you have discovered that linear multiple regression and the analysis of variance (and covariance)
> are identical systems, he would mutter something like "Of course—general linear model," and you might have trouble maintaining his attention. If you
> should say this to a typical psychologist, you would be met with incredulity, or worse. Yet it is true, and in its truth lie possibilities for more relevant and
> therefore more powerful research data.

Cohen, 1968

## History

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="48%"}

### Multiple Regression

- introduced c. 1900 in biological and behavioural sciences

- aligned to "natural variation" in observations

- shows that means $\bar{y}$ are related to groups $g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_n$

:::

::: {.column width="4%"}


:::

::: {.column width="48%"}


### ANOVA

- introduced c. 1920 in agricultural research

- aligned to experimentation and manipulation

- shows that groups $g_1,g_2,\ldots,g_n$ have different means $\bar{y}$


:::

::::

- both produce $F$-ratios, discussed in different language, but identical


## Why Teach GLM/Regression?

- GLM has less restrictive assumptions

  - especially true for unbalanced designs/missing data
  
- GLM is far better at dealing with covariates

  - can arbitrarily mix continuous and discrete predictors
  
- GLM is the gateway to other powerful tools

  - mixed models and factor analysis (→ MSMR)

  - structural equation models

```{r aov1}

::: notes
- the (default) model table shows you the differences from the grand mean, which is `r mean(toys$UTILITY)`

- so in the linear model summary the mean value for playmos is `r coef(l.mod)[1]` + `r coef(l.mod)[2]` or `r coef(l.mod)[1]+coef(l.mod)[2]`

- in the anova summary the mean value for playmos is `r mean(toys$UTILITY)` + `r model.tables(a.mod)$tables$type[2]` or `r mean(toys$UTILITY)+model.tables(a.mod)$tables$type[2]`

- however in the model table (from ANOVA) we don't know what differences are statistically significant, and we don't have diagnostics such as $R^2$

> Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship.
