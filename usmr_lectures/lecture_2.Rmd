# Measurement

.pull-left[
![:scale 70%](lecture_2_files/img/playmo_proft.svg)
]
.pull-right[
- we might _expect_ values close to the "true" measurement to be more frequent
- something like this:

.center[
```{r sketchnorm, echo=FALSE,fig.dim=c(3,3)}
stick <- data.frame(x=rnorm(70,.076116,.0025))
stick %>% ggplot(aes(x=x)) +
  xlim(0.06,0.09) +  
  geom_density() + scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=.076116,colour="red") +
  annotate(geom="text",colour="red",x=0.0785,y=25,label="TRUE MEASURE") +
  xlab('measurement') + ylab("") + theme_presentation(16)
```
]]

???
- so let's do a thought experiment and imagine what things
would look like if lots and lots of people tried to measure
the "true" distance of the notch from the end of the stick.

- most of them would be quite competent, and we would expect
the majority of the measurements to be close to the "true" value.

- every now and again, someone would overshoot or undershoot by rather
more.

- _theoretically_ they might be completely off-beam, although the chances of being way off get vanishingly small quite quickly.

# Something quite familiar

???
- if we think a bit more about our thought experiment, we've actually described
something quite familiar:  A bell curve

- but what is a "bell curve"?

- to answer that question, let's start back where we were last week, with dice.

# Dice again

```
]]

.pt3[
- bar plot ("bar chart") always has gaps between bars
- represents frequencies of _discrete categories_ (`factors`)
]

???
- I could just label the possible outcomes of throwing two dice arbitrarily
  
- if you think about it, there are only 11 possible values that the sum
  of two dice can take.
  
- and if the dice didn't have actual numbers on their faces, you could still
  enumerate the outcomes

- so the outcomes are _discrete_ (you can never throw a value between 3 and 4, or between "B and C")
- and the bars on a bar plot have gaps between them to show this.

## Sampling from a Population

---
background-image: url("lecture_2_files/img/playmo_pop.jpg")
???
We want to say something about the population, rather than about one stick.

For example -- what's their average height?
(We know this, it's on the packet, 7.5cm, but in the real world people differ...)

Let's go into RStudio and do a little simulation.

# Towards Statistical Testing

# Central Limit Theorem

- what we have just see is a demonstration of **Central Limit Theorem**

- lay version: _sample means will be normally distributed about the true mean_

.br3.center.pa2.pt2.bg-gray.white.f3[
the standard deviation ("width") of the distribution of sample means is referred to as the **standard error** of the distribution
]

---
# Central Limit Theorem (2)

- if you look up CLT on Wikipedia you'll see it's defined in terms of _adding two numbers_
  + the sample mean is a sum of _many_ numbers, divided by $n$

  + adding many numbers is like adding two numbers:
.pt0[
  $1 + 3 + 2 + 5 = (1 + 3 + 2) + 5 = 6 + 5$
]

  + dividing by something doesn't make any difference
  
---
# $n-1$

- we've just shown how adding many numbers is equivalent to adding two numbers

- so _if we know the sum_ of a bunch of numbers, $n-1$ of those numbers can be anything

.center[
```{r table,echo=FALSE}
library(gt)
t <- tibble(`sum of n-1 numbers`=c(90,102,67),`nth number`=c(10,-2,33),sum=c(100,100,100))
t %>% gt()
```
]

- so if we know a summary statistic (e.g., mean, sd) we know about the data with $n-1$ **degrees of freedom**

---
# Statistical Estimates

- so far, we've talked about sampling repeatedly from a population

- this might not be possible(!)

- if we only have one sample we can make _estimates_ of the mean and standard error

  + the estimated _mean_ is the sample mean (we have no other info)
  
  + the estimated _standard error_ of the mean is defined in terms of the sample standard deviation
  
  $$ \textrm{se} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}}}{\sqrt{n}} $$

---
# Putting it Together

- the _normal curve_ is a density plot with known properties

  + it can be defined in terms of two parameters, mean, and standard deviation

- if we repeatedly sample from a population and measure the mean of a population, we'll get a normal distribution

  + the mean will be (close to) the population mean
  
- if we sample once from a population which is approximately normal

  + our estimated mean and sd for the population are the sample mean and sd
  
  + the _standard error_, or standard deviation of the sample means can be estimated as $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$
