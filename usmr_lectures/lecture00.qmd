## Univariate Statistics...

```{r}
#| include: false

load('R/heights.Rdata')
heights <- heights |>
  mutate(gender=ifelse(gender=='Other','NonBinary',gender))
```

```{r}
heights # <1>
```

1. prints out the value of `heights`

- one row represents **one** *set of observations*

::: {.notes}
-   typically in Psychology, this might be the identity of the person being measured
-   example here - we have different peoples heights.
-   the variation comes from all these different people we've measured
-   as statisticians, we're interested in examining whether there are *systematic* differences, beyond the individual variation
-   for example, height predicted by gender?

## ...Using R...

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| tidy.opts: { width.cutoff: 24 }

heights |> ggplot(aes(
             x = HEIGHT,
             colour = gender, # <1>
             fill = gender)
            ) +
  geom_density(size=2, alpha=0.4)
```

1. `color = gender` is OK too

## ...to form conclusions

```{r}
heights_t <- heights |> filter(gender %in% c('Male','Female'))

t.test(heights_t$HEIGHT ~ heights_t$gender)
```

don't forget whatever it says here!

some text in [red]{.red} should be seen here

- and now [something]{.accent} **bold** I want [to]{.blue} say

$$\sqrt{\color{blue}{x}}$$
