- one row represents **one** *set of observations*

::: {.notes}
-   typically in Psychology, this might be the identity of the person being measured
-   example here - we have different peoples heights.
-   the variation comes from all these different people we've measured
-   as statisticians, we're interested in examining whether there are *systematic* differences, beyond the individual variation
-   for example, height predicted by gender?
:::

## ...and Methodology...

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="60%"}
- how do we measure height?
- how do we determine gender?
- how do we collect data in a way that is generalisable?

## ...Using R...

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| tidy.opts: { width.cutoff: 24 }

heights |> ggplot(aes(
             x = HEIGHT,
             colour = gender,
             fill = gender)
            ) +
  geom_density(size=2, alpha=0.4)
```


## ...to Form Conclusions

```{r}
heights_t <- heights |> filter(gender %in% c('Male','Female'))

t.test(heights_t$HEIGHT ~ heights_t$gender)
```

  + literate programming
  + document creation
:::

::: notes
- course covers a whole bunch of statistics. 
- based on particular branch - NHST, which is the dominant approach in most fields, where we assume that the thing we are observing is governed by chance, and we work out the probability of what we _have_ observed occuring by chance.  
- and if that's low, then we assume that other factors are at play.  
- we'll be needing to cover things about probability, samples and populations, and tests of significance. 

- the second block, starting week 6, starts to shift our focus to the linear model, which is a lovely way of thinking about analyses that provides the building blocks of many many complicated analyses. lots of the tests and models you might read about are either special cases of, or extensions of, the linear model.

::::

::: myyellowblock
- labs are the best place to get to grips with R and statistics
- you are expected to attend
:::

::: notes
- statistics, and especially R, is a very _practical_ skill.  

- we can't teach people to swim by just giving lectures on how to swim.

## Tips for Survival

- active engagement! 

- use the piazza forums and other forms of support

- keep on top of the coursework

- remember that some things will feel difficult at first
  - what's hard for you may be easy for others
  - what's easy for you may be hard for others
- most importantly, _don't give up_

::: notes
attend the lectures, and don't be afraid to ask any questions.  

if you don't understand something one of us says, then my guess is that either we made a mistake, or we didn't explain ourselves very well. 

there's a bit of an imposter syndrome problem in statistics, and it's very hard to tackle. 

important to remember why we're here, and that is to learn.

## Tips for Improving the Course

- we work constantly to improve this course, but fixing some things may well break others

- please feed back to us!

  - during labs/after lectures
  - via email, via forums, anonymously via "Have Your Say" on Learn
  
- please bear with us, we are doing our best

- any good course is a _conversation_ between teachers and learners

  - the course will only work well with your commitment and input

# Get Going

## 1. Help Us Get to Know You

- log into Learn, navigate to the USMR course page  

- look for the Piazza Forum button

  - it should automatically enroll you on
piazza

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Option A

RStudio Server

- accessed via a web browser (requires internet)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
#### Option B

Install R and RStudio

- instructions at <https://edin.ac/3B0oi5A>  
- process is a bit more involved

:::

::::

:::: r-stack

::: {.myyellowblock .fragment fragment-index=1 .fade-out}
**our recommendation**

- use Rstudio Server for now

- install R and RStudio over Xmas, in time for Semester 2 
:::

::: {style="font-size: .8em; color: gray;" .fragment fragment-index=1}
- *The PPLS Rstudio Server will undergo regular maintenance on the first Sunday of every month, so there may be a short interruption to the service on these days*  
- *Our agreement with RStudio allows us the use of RStudio Server for teaching purposes only. __Please do not use the RStudio Server for your dissertation__*  
:::

::::

## 3. Fill in the Survey

- find the survey at <https://edin.ac/3Eth1ML>

- takes 10--15 minutes to complete

- provides real data for the examples and exercises
